## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Implementation Complete** - All 77 redirects added to `vercel.json`
2. ✅ **JSON Validation** - File syntax is valid

### Deployment Steps:
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add comprehensive SEO redirects (77 rules) for domain migration"
git push
```

### Post-Deployment Testing:
1. Test high-value URLs:
   - `https://pragnaskinandlaserclinics.com/about-us/`
   - `https://pragnaskinandlaserclinics.com/contact-us`
   - `https://pragnaskinandlaserclinics.com/treatment/hifu`
   - `https://pragnaskinandlaserclinics.com/services/`

2. **Google Search Console**:
   - Monitor redirect coverage (should see decrease in 404 errors)
   - Check indexing status of new URLs
   - Submit updated sitemap if needed

3. **Analytics Monitoring**:
   - Watch for redirect traffic in Vercel analytics
   - Monitor any remaining 404s for additional redirects
   - Track organic traffic recovery

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **About-us & Contact-us** → Homepage
   - Rationale: New site has these sections embedded in homepage
   - Alternative: Could create dedicated pages if needed

2. **Services** → `/treatments`
   - Rationale: Treatments is the new equivalent structure
   - Preserves SEO value for service-related searches

3. **Blog** → `/treatments`
   - Rationale: No blog exists on new site
   - Most blog content was treatment-related

4. **Gallery** → Homepage
   - Rationale: No dedicated gallery page on new site
   - Could create if testimonials/before-after gallery needed

5. **General Articles** → `/conditions`
   - For educational skincare content without specific treatment focus
   - Helps maintain educational SEO value

---

## Monitoring & Optimization

### Week 1-2:
- Monitor 404 errors in Vercel logs
- Check Google Search Console for crawl errors
- Add any additional old URLs discovered

### Month 1:
- Review organic traffic recovery
- Check ranking changes for key terms
- Optimize meta tags on destination pages if needed

### Month 2-3:
- Evaluate redirect performance
- Consider if any pages need dedicated landing pages
