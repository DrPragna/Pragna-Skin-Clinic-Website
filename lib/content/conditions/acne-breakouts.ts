    description: "Acne happens when hair follicles become clogged with oil (sebum) and dead skin cells. This blockage can lead to whiteheads, blackheads, red inflamed pimples or deeper, painful cysts. It's common in both teenagers and adults, but the pattern and severity can differ from person to person."

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "How long will it take for my acne to clear?",
      a: "For severe acne, it may take around three months to see significant improvement, while milder cases may respond sooner. Your doctor will review progress regularly and fine-tune medicines and procedures as your skin improves."
    },
    {
      q: "Will I definitely need oral medicines?",
      a: "Not always. Very mild acne may respond well to a good skincare routine and topical medications alone. For moderate to severe or stubborn acne, oral medicines may be added to control inflammation and prevent scarring – this is decided after a detailed consultation and, if needed, basic investigations."

    {
      q: "Will this treatment remove my old acne scars?",
      a: "Active acne treatment focuses on controlling current breakouts and preventing new scars. Once your acne is stable, we can plan dedicated scar-revision procedures."

      q: "Can I wear makeup during treatment?",
      a: "Yes, but we'll guide you to use non-comedogenic products that won't clog pores or interfere with your treatment."
