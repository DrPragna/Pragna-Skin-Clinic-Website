    intro: "At Pragna, laser hair reduction is about more than \"hair removal\". Using diode, alexandrite and IPL platforms together, we safely target hair at the root across a wide range of skin tones and hair types, helping you move away from constant shaving or waxing towards smoother, low-maintenance skin."

    intro: "Laser hair reduction may be right for you if you:",
    points: [
      "Have unwanted hair on the face, underarms, arms, legs, bikini area or trunk.",
      "Struggle with in-grown hairs, razor bumps or darkening from frequent hair removal.",
      "Prefer a longer-term reduction instead of regular waxing or threading.",
      "Want a safe, dermatologist-supervised option that works across different skin tones."

  howItHelps: {
    description: "The laser light is absorbed by the pigment in the hair shaft and converted to heat, which selectively damages the hair follicle while protecting the surrounding skin. With each session, active hairs become finer and fewer, leading to a significant and often permanent reduction in growth over time.",

        title: "Treatment Sessions",
