    title: "Fire & Ice Facial",
    tagline: "Warm resurface, cool calm",
    intro:
      "Unlike harsh peels that leave you hiding at home, the Fire & Ice facial uses an intensive warm resurfacing mask followed by a deeply cooling mask to smooth, brighten and plump the skin with minimal downtime—famous as a \"red carpet\" favourite.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Single session or 3-4 in a series",
    duration: "45-60 mins",
    downtime: "Mild redness; occasional light flaking",
    painLevel: "Intense warmth for a few minutes, then cooling relief",
  },
  overview:
    "The \"fire\" phase typically contains resurfacing ingredients like glycolic acid and retinol derivatives, while the \"ice\" phase uses soothing botanicals and hydrating ingredients. Together, they help refine texture, soften fine lines and bring out a healthy glow suitable for many skin types.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You want more than a basic facial but less than a strong peel",
    "Fine lines and dullness bother you more than breakouts",
    "Your skin feels rough or thickened from sun and time",
    "You are okay with a few minutes of strong tingling for better results",
    "You are planning a function or shoot and want a camera-friendly finish",

        title: "Suitability and prep check",
        description:
          "We examine your skin for sensitivity, active acne, eczema or recent procedures and review any retinoids or acids you use. You may be asked to pause certain products to lower the risk of irritation. Very reactive skins may be steered toward a gentler facial instead.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Fire mask, then ice mask",
        description:
          "After cleansing, the \"fire\" resurfacing mask is applied in a thin layer. You will feel intense warmth and tingling that peaks over a few minutes before it is neutralised and removed. Immediately afterward, a cold, calming \"ice\" mask is applied to soothe, hydrate and reduce redness, followed by finishing serums and sunscreen.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Glow with mild sensitivity",
        description:
          "Expect some temporary redness and a tight feeling, especially in drier areas. Over the next few days, skin often feels smoother and looks clearer. A small amount of light flaking is possible as dull surface cells shed; we will give you a simple moisturiser-heavy routine to support this.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Within a few days, many people notice brighter skin, softer fine lines and smoother texture. A cluster of sessions around important life events, spaced a few weeks apart, can enhance and maintain this effect.",
    recovery:
      "Mild redness and sensitivity for a day or two is common, with possible light flaking. Most patients continue normal work but avoid heavy workouts, saunas and harsh actives for several days.",

    {
      question: "Is the Fire & Ice facial very painful?",
      answer:
        "The \"fire\" phase can feel quite hot and tingly for a few minutes, but this is temporary and followed by a very soothing cooling mask. Most people tolerate it well, but if it is too intense for you we can shorten the contact time or choose a different treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do Fire & Ice if I have active acne?",
      answer:
        "It depends on the severity and type of your acne. On very inflamed or pustular acne, we usually avoid resurfacing masks that can sting and instead use calmer protocols until things settle.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my skin peel in sheets?",
      answer:
        "No, this is not designed as a heavy peeling treatment. Some dryness or light flaking is possible for a few days, but dramatic shedding like with deep peels is not expected.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon before a wedding or event should I plan this?",
      answer:
        "If you have never done it before, we suggest a trial session at least 3-4 weeks prior, then a final session about 5-7 days before the main event, depending on how your skin responded.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Fire & Ice safe for all skin tones?",
      answer:
        "With correct selection and contact times, it can be used on Indian skin. We are conservative in darker or more reactive skin types to reduce the risk of post-inflammatory pigmentation.",
    },
