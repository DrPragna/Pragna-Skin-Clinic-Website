    intro:
      "This treatment focuses on brown spots, freckles and uneven patches that outstay every tan. We combine creams, peels, laser toning and facials to fade excess pigment gradually while respecting your skin barrier and natural shade.",

  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Typically 3–6 treatment sessions",
    duration: "Visits around 20–40 minutes",
    downtime: "Short redness, mild dryness",
    painLevel: "Mild tingling or warmth",
  },
  overview:
    "After assessing type and depth of pigmentation, we start medical creams and strict sunscreen, then add gentle peels, hydrafacials and Q-switch laser toning if needed. The aim is clearer tone and softer edges, not chalky, over-bleached skin.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You have flat brown spots left after pimples, injuries or waxing sessions.",
    "Freckles or sun spots on cheeks and nose keep deepening every summer.",
    "You notice dark patches from old rashes or friction around underarms or thighs.",
    "Shop creams promised instant fairness but caused stinging, peeling or patchy colour.",
    "You want focused spot lightening while keeping the rest of your face natural.",

        title: "Assess spots and history",
        description:
          "We map spots under good light, check photos over time, review hormones, pregnancies and products used. This helps separate melasma, sun spots and post-inflammatory marks so treatment targets the right pigment layer.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Start layered pigment care",
        description:
          "We start creams, sunscreen and, when suitable, peels, hydrafacials or Q-switch toning. Strength and frequency are increased gradually, watching closely for dryness, redness or itching so we can adjust before your skin feels overwhelmed.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Simplify and maintain gains",
        description:
          "As spots fade, we simplify your routine, sometimes shifting to milder maintenance agents. We reinforce everyday sun habits and follow-ups so gains hold through summers, holidays and small lapses in routine.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most people notice softer edges and slightly brighter spots within four to six weeks. Deeper patches usually take two to three months or longer, depending on depth, hormones and sun exposure.",
    recovery:
      "Most sessions cause short redness or mild dryness for a few days. With moisturiser and sunscreen, work, college and social plans can usually continue as normal.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Are pigmentation and tanning the same thing?",
      answer:
        "Not always. Tanning is usually uniform darkening after sun, while pigmentation includes localised patches, freckles and hormone-driven changes. We check pattern, history and depth before choosing creams, peels or lasers.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will pigmentation treatments make me completely fair?",
      answer:
        "No. The goal is to reduce excess pigment and uneven patches, not change your basic shade. When spots fade and tan reduces, skin naturally looks fresher and more even, without chasing unrealistic fairness targets.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do this while planning pregnancy?",
      answer:
        "Some medicines and strong peels are avoided during pregnancy planning, pregnancy and breastfeeding. We adjust protocols, rely more on sunscreen and gentle procedures and coordinate timing so safety remains first priority.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to stop using makeup?",
      answer:
        "We may pause heavy foundations right after peels or laser sessions, but light, non-comedogenic makeup is usually fine once skin settles, as long as removal is gentle and sunscreen stays consistent.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long will pigmentation results last?",
      answer:
        "Pigmentation tends to return if sun exposure, hormones or friction remain unchanged. With sensible sun habits, maintenance creams and timely top-up sessions, many people maintain brighter, more even tone for years.",
    },
