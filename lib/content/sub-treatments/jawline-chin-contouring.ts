    intro:
      "A soft or receding chin, early jowls or a blurred jawline can change how your entire face reads on camera. Jawline and chin contouring uses dermal fillers, strategically placed Botox and sometimes tightening devices to sculpt a cleaner side profile without surgery or implants.",

    sessions: "1 main session, review at 2-4 weeks",
    duration: "30-60 mins",

  overview:
    "By restoring structure along the chin and jawbone with hyaluronic acid fillers and selectively relaxing bulk-creating muscles, we redraw the lower-face contour. The aim is a crisper edge, reduced appearance of jowls and better balance between nose, lips and chin - all while keeping the result gender-appropriate and natural.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your chin looks shorter or 'weak' from the side",
    "You feel your lower face blends into your neck without a clear jawline",
    "Photos highlight jowls or a small pocket of fullness in front of the jowl",
    "You want more definition but prefer injectables over surgery",
    "You're okay with a result that lasts months to a couple of years, not permanent implants",

        title: "Designing your new outline",
        description:
          "We study your face in front and side views, marking areas where structure is lost or the jaw breaks. We discuss how sharp or soft you'd like the jawline to be and consider your gender, occupation and style. Photos and sometimes simple on-skin sketching help you visualise the intended change.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Filling, sculpting, refining",
        description:
          "After numbing, fillers are placed with a cannula or needle along the chin, prejowl sulcus and jawline, building structure on bone rather than puffiness in the soft tissue. In some cases, tiny doses of Botox are used along the masseter or platysma to refine the jaw angle. You may feel pressure and mild stinging as the product is shaped.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Settling into place",
        description:
          "You can expect some swelling, minor asymmetries and possible bruising for a few days. We'll show you what is normal and when to worry. A review at 2-4 weeks allows for minor top-ups or adjustments once the filler has settled and initial swelling has fully resolved.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "A visible change is seen immediately, though it may look slightly fuller for the first few days. As swelling subsides over 1-2 weeks, the final contour becomes clearer. Depending on the filler used and your metabolism, results typically last 9-18 months before needing a refresh.",
    recovery:
      "Most people return to work the next day with makeup to cover any bruises. You'll be asked to avoid heavy exercise, massages or pressure on the area for a couple of days.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will jawline fillers make my face look bigger?",
      answer:
        "When done correctly, we place filler close to bone to create structure, not puffiness. That usually makes the face look more defined, not larger. Overfilling in soft tissue planes is what creates a bulky look, which we actively avoid.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can this help my double chin?",
      answer:
        "Contour work can visually sharpen the jawline and prejowl area, which can reduce the appearance of a mild double chin. For true fat under the chin, we may recommend combining with tightening or fat-reducing treatments for best results.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do jawline fillers feel hard to touch?",
      answer:
        "Initially, you may feel slight firmness along the contour. As swelling settles and the filler integrates with tissue over a couple of weeks, it usually feels like part of your own structure, not a separate lump.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't like the result?",
      answer:
        "Most hyaluronic acid fillers can be adjusted or dissolved with an enzyme injection. We start with conservative amounts and build gradually so we stay within your comfort zone and avoid dramatic, irreversible changes.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this suitable for both men and women?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but the aesthetics differ. Many women prefer a slimmer, more tapered jawline, while men often want a squarer, stronger angle. We adapt the injection pattern and volume to match your desired look and facial proportions.",
