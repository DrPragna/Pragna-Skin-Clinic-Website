    intro:
      "This treatment uses fillers, tightening and sometimes fat reduction injections to refine jawline and chin shape. The aim is a clearer side profile and balanced proportions, not an artificial, over-sculpted look.",

    sessions: "Often 1–2 core sessions",
    duration: "Typically 30–60 minutes",
    downtime: "Swelling, bruises possible",

  overview:
    "We assess bone, fat and skin, then may use fillers along jawline or chin, tightening devices, or targeted fat-reduction injections under the chin. Plans are personalised to maintain harmony with the rest of your face.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your side profile looks weak or recessed because of a small chin or jawline.",
    "Photos highlight jowls or heaviness near jaw despite stable weight overall.",
    "Double chin persists even with diet, exercise and reasonable weight control.",
    "You want structure and definition but still recognisable features from every angle.",
    "You are curious about contouring but prefer medical guidance over trends.",

      {
        phase: "before",
        title: "Analyse profile and proportions",
        description:
          "We review front and side photos, assess chin projection, jaw angle, fat pads and skin quality, and discuss your goals. This shapes whether reduction, enhancement, or both are sensible and how subtle or strong to keep results.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform contouring procedures",
        description:
          "Depending on plan, we may inject fillers strategically, do tightening sessions, or small fat-reduction injections under the chin. Numbing cream, cannulas or fine needles help keep discomfort reasonable throughout the appointment.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Refine and balance later",
        description:
          "Fillers and tightening evolve over weeks. We reassess movement, symmetry and how you feel, then decide if any small additions or adjustments are needed to keep jawline, chin and neck working harmoniously.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Some definition appears immediately from fillers; tightening and fat reduction show gradually over one to six months. Final results depend on anatomy, lifestyle, devices and how many sessions are completed as planned.",
    recovery:
      "Expect swelling, tenderness or bruises for some days, especially after injections. We give clear measures to reduce discomfort and usually you can continue everyday routines with minor adjustments only.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will my jawline look obviously fake?",
      answer:
        "We prioritise proportion over sharpness for its own sake. Small, strategically placed changes often read as weight loss or better posture rather than cosmetic work, especially when chosen to suit your overall face.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can this remove double chin completely?",
      answer:
        "Fat-reduction injections help mild to moderate fullness, not very large pads or loose skin alone. We explain likely percentage improvement and sometimes advise combination with tightening or lifestyle changes for best results.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do jawline fillers last?",
      answer:
        "Many hyaluronic acid fillers last nine to eighteen months in this area, depending on product, metabolism and movement. Some structure remains even after full breakdown because your tissues adapt around previous support.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I need to keep doing touch-ups forever?",
      answer:
        "Fillers gradually reduce; some patients like yearly maintenance, others stop after one or two rounds. Tightening and lifestyle changes may extend intervals, so you can choose how often to refresh.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are jawline fillers painful or risky?",
      answer:
        "We use numbing, blunt cannulas where suitable, and strict protocols to reduce bruising and vascular risk. Serious complications are rare but discussed honestly, and you receive clear emergency instructions.",
    },
  ],
