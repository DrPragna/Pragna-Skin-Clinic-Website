    intro:
      "Horizontal neck lines and crepey skin often show age even when the face looks fresh. Our neck line protocols combine collagen stimulation (MNRF, fractional lasers, PRP) with injectables like Profhilo, skin boosters and carefully placed fillers to soften the rings and improve texture.",

    sessions: "3-4 sessions for texture; 1-2 for injectables",

  overview:
    "Neck skin is thinner, constantly in motion and often neglected in skincare, so lines appear earlier. By delivering energy and hydration deeper into the neck, we encourage collagen remodelling and better elasticity while avoiding an over-filled, stiff look.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You see distinct horizontal 'rings' whenever you look down at your phone",
    "Your neck looks more lined than your face in photos",
    "High necks or jewellery highlight creases you'd rather not show",
    "You've tried creams but they don't seem to change the lines",
    "You want improvement without a surgical neck lift",

        title: "Studying lines & skin quality",
        description:
          "We assess whether your main issue is true etched-in lines, loose skin, volume loss or sun damage. This decides whether we favour MNRF/fractional lasers, injectable skin boosters like Profhilo, PRP, or fine-line fillers. We also review your phone and work posture habits, as they play a big role in 'tech neck'.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Treating rings at multiple levels",
        description:
          "For texture and fine lines, MNRF or fractional Erbium/CO2 create controlled micro-channels of heat - feeling like a grid of hot pinpricks. PRP or skin boosters are then injected as tiny microdroplets across the neck. Deeper, stubborn grooves may receive a carefully placed soft filler thread along the line to lift the crease.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Healing & neck care reset",
        description:
          "Pinpoint marks, redness and mild swelling are expected for 1-3 days, so we advise loose collars and gentle skincare. Sun protection on the neck becomes non-negotiable. Over the next weeks, we adjust your home routine and posture habits so new lines are less likely to form as quickly.",
      },

  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Texture and crepiness usually improve over 4-8 weeks as collagen builds after each energy session. Lines softened with fillers or skin boosters often look better immediately, with further refinement as swelling settles. A typical course of 3-4 visits gives the most noticeable change.",
    recovery:
      "Most people plan this when they can dress casually for a few days. Marks and mild tightness are common but usually easy to conceal or ignore after the first 48-72 hours.",

    {
      question: "Why are my neck lines so strong even though I'm young?",
      answer:
        "Neck lines are not only about age. Constantly looking down at screens, sleeping positions, sun damage and genetics can create early, visible rings even in your 20s. Treating them early can prevent them from becoming very deep grooves later.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will treating neck lines make my neck look stiff?",
      answer:
        "No. We use softer gels and skin boosters, not heavy structural fillers, and spread them in microdroplets. Energy devices work by stimulating your own collagen. The goal is a supple, smoother neck that still moves naturally when you talk or turn.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do results last?",
      answer:
        "Results from fillers or Profhilo usually last 9-12 months, while collagen from energy-based treatments can hold even longer but will still age with you. Many people repeat a lighter session once or twice a year as maintenance.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I treat the neck and face in the same sitting?",
      answer:
        "Often yes, especially when we're using PRP, skin boosters or fractional lasers with adjusted settings. Sometimes we stage more intense treatments to keep downtime manageable. Your plan will be designed around your work and social calendar.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will one treatment erase deep neck lines?",
      answer:
        "Deep rings usually need a staged plan - collagen stimulation plus one or more filler or booster sessions. One visit can give visible improvement, but complete erasing is unrealistic. We'll discuss what level of change is realistic for your skin.",
