    tagline: "Smooth tech-neck creases",
    intro:
      "This treatment targets horizontal neck lines and mild sagging caused by posture, ageing and sun. We combine tightening devices, Profhilo-type skin boosters, peels and sometimes fillers to improve texture while keeping neck movement free.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Usually 3–4 focused sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 30–60 minutes",
    downtime: "Redness, small bruises possible",
    painLevel: "Numbing, heat, mild sting",
  },
  overview:
    "Treatments may include HIFU, MNRF, fractional lasers, hydrating injectables and supportive skincare. We choose combinations based on your line depth, laxity, comfort with needles and how much downtime you can realistically spare.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Horizontal neck lines show up clearly on selfies and video calls.",
    "Your neck skin looks crepey compared with your relatively smooth face.",
    "Long hours on phone or laptop have deepened front-of-neck folds.",
    "You feel conscious wearing open necklines, saris or certain blouses.",
    "You prefer non-surgical options before considering threads or surgery.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Assess neck lines carefully",
        description:
          "We examine depth, number and distribution of lines, feel laxity and check your posture patterns. Photos, age and face condition together guide how much tightening, hydration or filler support the neck realistically needs.",
      },

        phase: "during",
        title: "Deliver tightening and hydration",
        description:
          "Depending on plan, we may perform HIFU, MNRF, fractional laser passes or inject skin boosters along lines. Numbing cream, cooling and careful markings help keep the process tolerable and precise.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Reinforce with habits and care",
        description:
          "We reinforce sun protection, screen-time posture and moisturising so new lines do not form as quickly. Follow-ups track smoothness, crepe level and comfort, guiding whether extra tightening or boosters are worth repeating.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Textural improvement usually appears over two to three months, with further gains up to six months when collagen-boosting treatments are used and hydration, posture and sunscreen habits improve.",
    recovery:
      "Redness, pinpoint marks or bruises may show for some days. High-neck clothing and gentle skincare usually hide these well while the neck continues healing underneath.",

    {
      question: "Are neck lines only from ageing?",
      answer:
        "No. Phones, laptops, side-sleeping, genetics and sun also contribute. We discuss lifestyle alongside procedures so improvements you gain from treatment are not undone quickly by daily habits.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can cream alone fix neck lines?",
      answer:
        "Good skincare helps texture but cannot fully remove etched lines. Combining moisturisers, sun care and doctor-led procedures usually gives clearer, longer-lasting smoothness than cream-only approaches.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will tightening make my neck slimmer too?",
      answer:
        "Tightening mainly improves texture and lift, not large fat pads. For full necks we may discuss combining with fat reduction methods or broader weight management for best visible change.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is neck treatment safe near thyroid area?",
      answer:
        "Energy-based devices are applied with care over front neck, avoiding deep heating of thyroid. We adjust passes, keep sessions spaced and consider your medical history before suggesting any plan.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon before an event should I treat?",
      answer:
        "We prefer several weeks, especially if injectables or strong devices are involved. That window lets redness, swelling and any bruises settle so you attend functions confident and comfortable.",
    },
