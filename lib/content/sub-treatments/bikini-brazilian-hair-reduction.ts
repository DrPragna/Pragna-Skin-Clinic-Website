    intro:
      "Bikini line bumps, ingrown hairs, and waxing pain can make beaches, pools, and even everyday gymwear feel uncomfortable. Bikini and Brazilian laser hair reduction offers a more long-term, skin-friendly way to manage hair in intimate areas.",

  overview:
    "We treat either just the bikini line or a more extensive Brazilian pattern based on your comfort. Settings are gentler and passes are slower because the skin is more sensitive here, but the goal remains the same: fewer ingrowns, slower regrowth, and easier hygiene.",

    "Waxing the bikini area feels extremely painful or leaves bruises",
    "Shaving causes razor burn, itching, or ingrown hair along the bikini line",
    "You feel conscious in swimwear, dancewear, or tight leggings",
    "You want a private, medical setting instead of crowded salons",

        description:
          "We explain exactly which pattern (bikini or Brazilian) is included and how much hair you'd like to keep, if any. You'll be advised to shave the area as directed before the appointment and to avoid waxing or hair removal creams for several weeks beforehand.",

        description:
          "You are draped appropriately, and only the area being treated is exposed at a time. After cleansing, the laser handpiece is applied in sections. You'll feel sharp, warm snaps that last a second each. Breaks are offered whenever needed, and the whole session typically finishes within 20-40 minutes.",

        title: "Soothing, Hygiene & Clothing Tips",
        description:
          "Post-treatment, the skin can feel tender or slightly swollen, similar to a strong waxing session but without sticky residue. We recommend breathable cotton underwear, avoiding tight leggings and intense workouts for 24 hours, and washing with lukewarm water and gentle cleansers.",

    timeline:
      "By the third or fourth session, many patients report far fewer ingrowns and much slower regrowth. After 6-8 sessions, maintenance is usually minimal, and the skin tends to feel calmer and less irritated overall.",
    recovery:
      "Most tenderness resolves within a day. Redness and slight swelling are common but temporary. Good hygiene and avoiding friction help the area settle comfortably.",

    {
      question: "How do you maintain privacy during bikini or Brazilian laser?",
      answer:
        "Sessions are done in a closed room by trained female staff (where requested), with draping to expose only the area being treated. We explain each step before doing it so you never feel rushed or surprised.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Brazilian laser safe for the intimate area?",
      answer:
        "We avoid treating internal mucosal surfaces and focus on the external bikini region and surrounding hair. Settings are carefully chosen to respect the sensitivity of the area.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do laser if I have active infection or rash?",
      answer:
        "If there is any active infection, rash, or broken skin, we will first treat that and postpone laser. It's important the skin is intact for safe treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to stop sexual activity after the session?",
      answer:
        "We usually advise avoiding sexual activity for 24 hours after treatment to minimise friction and irritation on freshly treated skin.",
