  overview:
    "We use specially adjusted laser settings and careful positioning to treat bikini line or full Brazilian zones. Over time, hair reduces, ingrowns settle and the area feels easier to maintain between sessions.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Bikini waxing is extremely painful and leaves you sore for days.",
    "Ingrown hairs, boils or dark spots appear often in your bikini area.",
    "Shaving causes razor burn, itching or small cuts in sensitive skin.",
    "You want cleaner lines for swimwear or intimate comfort without parlour stress.",

        title: "Treat with privacy and care",
        description:
          "The area is shaved as discussed, cleaned and covered with gel. With proper draping, we perform laser passes, frequently checking comfort and adjusting energy, angles and pace for sensitive spots.",

        title: "Support healing and hygiene",
        description:
          "We advise breathable clothing, gentle cleansing, avoiding hot baths, friction and strong products for a short period. Follow-ups track regrowth, bumps and pigment so we can tweak the plan.",

    timeline:
      "Many notice fewer ingrowns and slower regrowth after a few sessions. Significant reduction in coarse hair usually appears towards the later part of the planned treatment course.",

      "Redness, warmth and tenderness are common for some hours. Cool compresses, loose cotton clothing and simple moisturiser generally keep you comfortable.",

    {
      question: "Is bikini laser embarrassing or awkward?",
      answer:
        "We prioritise privacy, clear communication and professional draping. Once you see the process and pace, most initial awkwardness fades and sessions feel like any other medical treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do laser during my periods?",
      answer:
        "We usually avoid sessions during heavy flow for comfort and hygiene. If scheduling is tight, we can sometimes treat carefully with a tampon or cup, but we plan this together.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does bikini laser affect fertility or internal organs?",
      answer:
        "No. The laser targets superficial hair follicles only and does not penetrate to reproductive organs. Safety checks focus on skin, pigment and hair, not internal structures.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should I wax or shave before bikini laser?",
      answer:
        "Shaving is preferred. Waxing removes the hair root, reducing laser targets. We give clear shaving instructions so stubble length is ideal for each appointment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I still need any hair removal later?",
      answer:
        "Some fine or light strands may remain, but overall density usually drops a lot. Many people only need occasional trimming or infrequent touch-ups instead of frequent waxing.",
    },
