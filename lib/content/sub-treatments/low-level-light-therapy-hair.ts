    title: "Low-Level Light Therapy for Hair",
    tagline: "Gentle light, scalp support",
    intro:
      "Low-Level Light Therapy for Hair uses specific wavelengths of light delivered to the scalp to support cell activity around hair follicles. It is non-invasive and usually combined with medicines or procedures as a gentle, add-on treatment for thinning.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Multiple sessions per week",
    duration: "Each session 15–30 minutes",
    downtime: "No real procedural downtime",
    painLevel: "Warmth, comfortable treatment",
  },
  overview:
    "Devices emitting low-level red or near-infrared light are applied close to the scalp. The light is thought to enhance cellular energy and micro-circulation around follicles, offering supportive benefit alongside well-planned medical hair-loss care, used as a structured program over time.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You prefer non-invasive, device-based options alongside medicines, not injections.",
    "Your dermatologist has already started topical and oral hair-loss treatments.",
    "You can attend frequent sessions or reliably use a recommended home device.",
    "Thinning is early or moderate rather than completely bald, shiny areas.",
    "You understand LLLT supports other care, it rarely works alone.",

        title: "Decide on LLLT role",
        description:
          "We confirm your diagnosis, review current treatments and decide whether clinic-based or home-use LLLT makes sense. We explain available evidence, realistic expectations and the commitment required for device-based therapies.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Comfortable light sessions",
        description:
          "During sessions, you sit with the device positioned over the scalp for a set period. There is usually only gentle warmth or tingling; most patients read, listen to music or relax meanwhile.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Monitor benefit over months",
        description:
          "We track shedding, density and your consistency over months. If LLLT suits you, it remains part of long-term maintenance along with medicines, nutrition and stress-management steps already in place.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Benefits, when they occur, are usually gradual over several months, with many people reporting reduced shedding and better hair feel rather than dramatic overnight density changes, if used consistently as advised.",
    recovery:
      "There is no real downtime. Some people feel transient warmth or mild scalp sensitivity. Because it is non-invasive, LLLT usually slots into routines easily once scheduling is planned.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is there strong scientific proof for LLLT?",
      answer:
        "Evidence suggests benefit in some people with pattern thinning, especially as an add-on, but responses vary. We explain current data and use it only as part of a broader, sensible hair-loss plan.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I buy any random online LLLT device?",
      answer:
        "Device quality, wavelength, power and treatment protocol matter. We prefer assessing options with you rather than unmonitored online purchases, so money and effort go into devices likely to match your needs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is LLLT safe for long-term use?",
      answer:
        "Low-level light is generally considered safe when used correctly. We still recommend periodic reviews to check response, adjust duration and ensure you are not relying on devices instead of addressing underlying causes.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stop all medicines if LLLT helps?",
      answer:
        "We usually do not recommend abruptly stopping proven medicines just because a device is added. Instead, we reassess together and taper only when stable control is maintained over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon will I see visible results?",
      answer:
        "If LLLT works for you, changes are usually gradual over months rather than days. We track hair photographs and your own feedback before deciding whether continuing the program is worthwhile.",
    },
