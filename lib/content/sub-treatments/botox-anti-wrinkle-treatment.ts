    intro:
      "Forehead lines that show even when you're not raising your brows, frown lines that make you look angry or tired, tiny crow's feet near the eyes—Botox helps relax the muscles that create these expression lines, so your face looks fresher without changing who you are.",

  overview:
    "Botox (botulinum toxin type A) is injected in very small, controlled doses into specific muscles. It reduces excessive movement that folds the skin, softening lines on the forehead, between the brows, around the eyes and in other areas like the chin, jaw and neck. The goal is natural relaxation, not a frozen, expressionless face.",

    "You see lines on your forehead or between your brows even when your face is at rest",

    "You clench or grind your teeth and notice a wide, bulky jawline from the side",

        description:
          "We watch how your face moves when you talk, smile, frown and raise your brows and may take photographs. Medical history, pregnancy/breastfeeding status and any neuromuscular conditions are discussed. We mark key injection points and agree on how soft you want the result—very subtle, moderate or more dramatic.",

        title: "Precise micro-injections",
        description:
          "After cleansing and, if needed, numbing cream, very fine needles are used to place tiny amounts of Botox into the planned muscles. You'll feel quick stings or pressure for a second or two at each point. Forehead, frown, crow's feet and jaw areas are usually completed within 15-30 minutes.",

        title: "Settling period and precautions",
        description:
          "Small bumps or redness at injection sites flatten within 20-30 minutes. We ask you to avoid rubbing or massaging the area, lying flat for 3-4 hours, heavy exercise, hot saunas/steam and facials that day. Results are reviewed after about two weeks to fine-tune future dosing.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "You may notice a slight softening of movement in 3-5 days, with full effect around 10-14 days. Lines made by expressions gradually look less sharp. Results typically last 3-4 months for first-timers and can extend to 4-6 months with regular, well-timed treatments.",
    recovery:
      "Most people return to work or social plans immediately. Mild bruising or headache can occur but usually settles within a few days and is manageable with simple measures.",

    {
      question: "Will Botox make my face look frozen or fake?",
      answer:
        "That depends entirely on how it's used. At our clinic, the aim is to soften harsh lines, not erase every movement. We use conservative dosing and place injections thoughtfully so you can still express yourself, just without the deep creasing.",
    },
    {
      question: "When should I do Botox if I have an important event or wedding?",
      answer:
        "Ideally, have your treatment about 3-4 weeks before the event. That gives time for the effect to kick in fully and for any small bruises to fade. It also allows us to adjust future doses based on how you like the result.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Botox safe to use regularly over many years?",
      answer:
        "When used correctly in appropriate doses and intervals, Botox has a long safety history worldwide. Muscles may gradually learn not to over-contract, which can actually help lines stay softer. We always avoid over-treating and respect safe dosing guidelines.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't like the result—am I stuck with it?",
      answer:
        "Botox is temporary. If you feel a certain area is too relaxed, the effect gradually wears off over a few months. We note your feedback carefully and adjust injection points and dosage at future visits to match your preference more closely.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Botox help with jaw clenching or tension headaches?",
      answer:
        "Yes, carefully placed Botox in the masseter muscles can reduce grinding-related pain and soften a bulky jawline over time. It may also help with certain tension headache patterns. Suitability depends on your specific case and is assessed during consultation.",
