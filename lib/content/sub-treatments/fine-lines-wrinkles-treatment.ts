      "Forehead lines, frown lines and crow's feet can make you look angry or tired even on a good day. Our fine lines and wrinkle protocols use targeted Botox, PRP/GFC, fractional lasers and skin boosters to relax harsh lines, support collagen and smooth the skin surface without wiping out your expressions.",

  overview:
    "Rather than relying on a single tool, we combine small-dose Botox for expression lines with collagen-building options like fractional Erbium/CO2, MNRF and PRP or GFC. This softens etched-in wrinkles and improves skin quality, so your skin moves naturally but doesn't crease as deeply.",

    "You see lines on your forehead or between your brows even when you're not frowning",
    "Your eye makeup sits in the fine lines around your eyes",

        description:
          "We map your wrinkle patterns at rest and in expression and discuss what you like and dislike about your face. Depending on depth and location, we may recommend a small-dose Botox plan, fractional resurfacing, PRP/GFC or a mix. Blood thinners and important events are considered while scheduling.",

        title: "Targeting lines at different depths",
        description:
          "Expression lines are treated with tiny Botox injections placed strategically in the forehead, frown area or crow's feet. Deeper etched lines may get fractional laser or MNRF, which feels like warm pinpricks. PRP or GFC can be injected or combined with microneedling to boost collagen in the treated zones.",

        title: "Gradual smoothing & upkeep",
        description:
          "Injection marks and redness from lasers or MNRF usually settle within a few hours to a couple of days. We guide you on sun protection, makeup timing and skincare actives. Botox settles over 5-7 days; collagen-building procedures show clearer improvement over 4-12 weeks.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "Botox-like wrinkle relaxing starts showing within 3-7 days, with peak effect by 2 weeks. Collagen-driven treatments such as PRP, GFC and fractional lasers build results slowly - typically smoother texture and softer lines over 6-12 weeks, improving further with follow-up sessions.",
    recovery:
      "Most people return to regular routine the same day. Fractional or MNRF sessions may cause mild redness or tiny grid marks for 2-3 days, so it's better to avoid big events during that window.",

    {
      question: "Can I still move my face after treating my wrinkles?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We focus on softening harsh lines, not erasing every movement. Doses and injection points are chosen so you can raise your eyebrows, smile and express yourself - just without the constant crease lines that bother you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to choose between Botox and lasers, or can they be combined?",
      answer:
        "They can be combined and often work best together. Botox addresses muscle-related lines, while fractional lasers, MNRF, PRP or GFC improve skin texture and fine lines. We'll time them so healing and results don't clash with your work or social schedule.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do wrinkle treatments last?",
      answer:
        "Botox-type relaxation usually lasts 3-4 months for most people. Collagen-driven improvements from lasers, MNRF and PRP/GFC can last longer but will continue to age with you. Many patients choose light maintenance a few times a year to stay ahead of deeper creasing.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will people be able to tell I did something?",
      answer:
        "Our aim is that you look well-rested and smoother, not 'done'. Changes appear over days to weeks, so people are more likely to say you look fresh or ask if you've been sleeping better, not guess the specific treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there an ideal age to start wrinkle treatments?",
      answer:
        "There's no fixed age. Some people in their late 20s or early 30s start when lines are just forming, while others come later when wrinkles are deeper. The earlier you treat strong expression lines, the easier it is to prevent them from etching in permanently.",
