      "This treatment targets forehead lines, frown lines and crow's feet using Botox and skin-quality procedures, aiming for smoother skin that still moves naturally when you smile, speak or raise your eyebrows.",

  overview:
    "We use tiny doses of botulinum toxin to relax overactive muscles, often combined with peels, laser toning or MNRF for texture. The goal is softer lines, not a frozen look, so you still recognise your own expressions.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your forehead lines deepen even when your face is otherwise relaxed.",
    "Crow's feet show sharply in every photograph, even with soft lighting.",
    "Frown lines make you look upset or tired, even on good days.",
    "You want to try Botox but are worried about looking frozen.",
    "You prefer subtle change that friends notice as freshness, not procedure talk.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Map lines and movement",
        description:
          "We study your face at rest and in expression, mark muscle pull patterns, review photos and discuss concerns and events. This helps decide doses, areas and whether to combine with peels or collagen treatments.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Place precise micro-doses",
        description:
          "Fine needles place tiny toxin doses into selected muscles. Most people feel brief pinpricks. We keep you upright afterward, check symmetry and adjust future plans based on how your expressions settle over two weeks.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Review effect and refine",
        description:
          "At follow-up, we compare before–after photos, check how lines and brows look and discuss how you felt during the cycle. Future sessions can tweak strength, areas or add skin-quality work for better texture.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Lines usually soften over three to seven days, with peak effect around two weeks. Results generally last three to six months, depending on dose, muscle strength, metabolism and how expressive your face normally is.",
    recovery:
      "Small bumps and redness at injection points usually settle within an hour. Bruises are uncommon but possible; simple cover-up makeup can be used after twenty-four hours if needed.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will I look fake or overdone?",
      answer:
        "Our goal is 'fresh, well-rested', not reshaped. We use conservative doses initially, then adjust only if you feel comfortable. Most friends just notice that you look less tired or angry, not that something was done.",
    },
    {
      question: "What age is right to start Botox?",
      answer:
        "There is no fixed 'correct' age. We look at line depth, family tendencies and your feelings about them. Some people start early with light doses; others begin later when lines stay even at rest.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stop treatment later without issues?",
      answer:
        "Yes. If you stop, muscles slowly regain full strength and lines return to their natural pattern over months. There is no rebound worsening because of the medicine itself, only normal ageing continuing.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Botox safe for migraines or sweating?",
      answer:
        "Botulinum toxin is also used medically for migraine and excessive sweating, but dose, pattern and dilution differ. If you already receive it elsewhere, we coordinate plans so total units and injection sites remain safe.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine Botox with fillers?",
      answer:
        "Often yes, especially when lines and volume loss coexist. We might treat movement with Botox and restore lost fullness with fillers or skin boosters, sequencing them to match events, downtime and your budget.",
    },
