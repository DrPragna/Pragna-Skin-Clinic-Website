    title: "Acne Scar Treatment",
    tagline: "Smoothen uneven texture",
    intro: "Acne scars can remain long after pimples have settled and may make the skin look uneven in certain light. At Pragna Skin Clinic, we use a combination of advanced dermatology treatments to gradually soften scars, improve texture, and make skin look smoother and more even."
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "3-6 sessions, 4-6 weeks apart",
    duration: "45-60 mins per session",
    downtime: "1-3 days of redness or sensitivity",
    painLevel: "Mild to moderate with numbing cream"
  },
  overview: "Different scars need different approaches. We assess whether your scars are rolling, boxcar, or ice-pick type, and then use suitable treatments like microneedling-based procedures, fractional lasers, subcision, specialised peels, or PRP-based therapies. The goal is to stimulate collagen, release tethered scars, and improve overall skin texture over time.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Detailed Scar Assessment & Planning",
        description: "Your dermatologist studies your scars closely, sometimes using different lighting angles or photographs. We discuss your medical history, past treatments, and downtime expectations. You may be asked to use certain creams, sunscreen, or stop actives for a few days before procedures to prepare the skin."
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Targeted Scar Procedures",
        description: "Numbing cream is applied to keep you comfortable. Depending on your scar type, we may perform microneedling-based treatments, laser sessions, subcision, or a combination. You may feel pressure, mild pricking, or warmth during the procedure, which usually takes 45-60 minutes."
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Healing Support & Follow-Up",
        description: "Expect some redness, mild swelling, or tiny marks for a few days, depending on the treatment depth. You will be given clear instructions on cleansing, moisturising, and sun protection. Follow-up visits allow us to monitor healing, space sessions correctly, and adjust the plan if needed."

  results: {
    timeline: "Most people notice smoother texture and softer scars gradually over 3-6 sessions, with improvements continuing for several months as collagen remodelling takes place. Results are progressive rather than overnight, and realistic goals are discussed before starting.",
    recovery: "You may need a short social downtime of 1-3 days after deeper sessions, with redness and sensitivity. With proper aftercare and sun protection, the skin usually settles well and looks healthier over the long term."
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Are acne scar treatments permanent?",
      answer: "Once new collagen is formed and scars are improved, results are generally long lasting. However, no treatment can promise to erase scars completely. Our goal is to make scars far less noticeable and your overall skin texture smoother and more even."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my scars look worse after treatment?",
      answer: "Scars may look temporarily redder or more obvious for a few days while the skin is healing, but this settles. With properly planned treatments and aftercare, the long-term direction is improvement, not worsening, and all procedures are chosen to suit your skin type."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe for darker Indian skin?",
      answer: "Yes. We choose technologies, depths, and energy levels carefully to suit Indian skin and reduce the risk of pigmentation. Pre- and post-procedure care with sunscreen and soothing products further help protect your skin during healing."
    },
    {
      question: "How many sessions will I need?",
      answer: "Most people need between 3 and 6 sessions, spaced 4-6 weeks apart, depending on scar depth, type, and your skin's healing response. Very deep or long-standing scars may need a longer course or combination approaches, which we discuss clearly at the start."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine scar treatment with active acne care?",
      answer: "Active acne must be brought under reasonable control before we aggressively treat scars. In some cases, mild scar-focused procedures can be started while acne treatment is ongoing, but your dermatologist will prioritise controlling new breakouts first."
