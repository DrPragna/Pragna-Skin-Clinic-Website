    intro:
      "Old acne may have gone, but the dents, pits and shadows remain. Acne Scar Treatment combines precise procedures to release tethered scars and stimulate collagen, helping texture look smoother without over-treating your skin.",

    sessions: "Usually 4–6 procedure sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 30–90 minutes",
    downtime: "Redness, scabs for few days",

  overview:
    "We tailor combinations of subcision, microneedling, MNRF, fractional lasers or focal TCA based on scar type. Sessions are spaced several weeks apart so collagen can rebuild gradually and results stay safe for your skin tone.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You see small pits or dents that stay even after acne disappeared.",
    "Makeup settles into holes and lines, making scars look deeper in photos.",
    "Running fingers across cheeks, you feel uneven, tethered areas under skin.",
    "Your acne is mostly controlled, but old scars still affect your confidence.",
    "You worry aggressive lasers might darken your naturally brown skin.",

        description:
          "We study scars in different light and angles, sometimes stretching skin to see rolling, boxcar and ice pick patterns. Photos and your downtime comfort help us plan which procedures to start with first.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Combine targeted procedures",
        description:
          "We may release tethered scars with subcision, use microneedling or MNRF for collagen and fractional lasers or focal TCA for surface texture. Each session is adjusted to your healing pattern and pigmentation risk.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Support healing and collagen",
        description:
          "We guide you on soothing creams, sunscreen and when to restart actives. Redness, tiny scabs or track marks fade over days, while deeper remodelling continues quietly for months between sessions.",
      },

  results: {
    timeline:
      "Edges often look softer by the second or third session. Noticeable smoothing of texture usually builds over six to twelve months as collagen matures, especially if acne remains under good control.",
    recovery:
      "Expect redness, mild swelling and tiny scabs for a few days, sometimes longer after stronger lasers. Important events should be kept at least two weeks away from treatment dates.",

    {
      question: "Can very old acne scars still improve?",
      answer:
        "Yes, age of scars matters less than depth and pattern. Improvement is usually partial, not perfect, but softening edges and shadows can make skin and makeup look noticeably smoother in daily life.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many acne scar sessions will I need?",
      answer:
        "Most people need four to six focused sessions, sometimes more for widespread scarring. We review progress each visit and adjust combinations so every session adds value instead of repeating the same approach blindly.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will acne scar treatment darken my skin?",
      answer:
        "Any strong procedure can trigger temporary darkening on brown skin if aftercare is ignored. We customise depth, protect with sunscreen and gradually increase intensity only when we see your skin tolerates it well.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do acne scar procedures hurt a lot?",
      answer:
        "We apply thick numbing cream and allow enough time before starting. You may still feel pressure, pricking or heat, but discomfort is usually brief and settles soon after the session ends.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my skin look worse between sessions?",
      answer:
        "Right after treatment, redness or scabs can draw attention to scars temporarily. Once healed, most people notice gradual softening rather than worsening, provided sunscreen and other aftercare instructions are followed.",
    },
