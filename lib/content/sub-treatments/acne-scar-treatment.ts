    intro:
      "Even after acne is gone, scars can keep the story alive - small pits, craters, uneven texture that shows in every sidelight. Acne scar treatment uses a customised mix of subcision, TCA CROSS, MNRF, PRP and fractional lasers to gradually smooth the surface and soften the way scars catch the light.",

    sessions: "3-6 sessions, 4-8 weeks apart",

  overview:
    "We first classify your scars - ice pick, rolling, boxcar, mixed or hypertrophic - because each type needs a different tool. Subcision releases tethered scars, TCA CROSS targets deep ice picks, MNRF and fractional CO2/Erbium resurface texture, and PRP or GFC supports healing and collagen from within.",

        description:
          "We examine your scars in different lighting and angles, often clicking close-up photos. Scar types are mapped - ice pick, rolling, boxcar, raised or pigmented. We also check your current acne status; if new pimples are still appearing, we may first work on controlling them before aggressive scar work.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Layered scar procedures",
        description:
          "After numbing, subcision is done with a special needle or cannula to break the fibrous bands pulling scars down, which may feel like pressure and mild tugging. TCA CROSS is applied with a fine tip into deep, narrow scars. MNRF or fractional lasers then resurface broader areas with a warm, prickly sensation. PRP or GFC may be injected or used with microneedling to enhance healing.",

        title: "Healing, redness and collagen time",
        description:
          "You can expect redness, swelling, tiny scabs or grid marks for a few days. Bruising is possible where subcision is done. We give a strict routine with gentle cleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen and clear guidance on what to avoid - no picking, scrubs or salon facials until fully healed.",

    timeline:
      "Most people notice early changes - smoother makeup application, softer edges to scars - after 1-2 sessions. Collagen remodelling continues for months, and best results are usually seen after 3-6 sessions spaced out over 6-12 months, depending on severity and skin type.",
    recovery:
      "Plan for 3-7 days where your skin may look clearly 'treated' - red, spotty or slightly swollen. Many patients schedule sessions so that the most visible phase falls on weekends or lighter work periods.",

    {
      question: "Can old acne scars from many years ago still improve?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Even scars from 5-10 years ago can respond to subcision, MNRF and fractional lasers because these treatments stimulate new collagen. Older scars may need more sessions, but improvement is still possible.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will scar treatments make my skin darker?",
      answer:
        "Any strong treatment carries a risk of temporary pigmentation, especially in Indian skin. We minimise this by careful parameter selection, pre- and post-procedure creams and strict sun protection. If you're prone to dark marks, we build in extra pigment control and gentler settings.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can scars disappear 100%?",
      answer:
        "Completely erasing all scars is rarely realistic, especially for very deep or widespread scarring. Our goal is to reduce depth, soften edges and improve overall texture so scars are much less noticeable in everyday light and photos.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you decide between MNRF and fractional lasers?",
      answer:
        "MNRF delivers energy through microneedles, which can be safer for certain darker skin tones and for scars needing deeper tightening. Fractional CO2/Erbium works more on the surface texture. We often combine or alternate them based on your scar pattern and healing response.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I need time off work or college?",
      answer:
        "Many people manage with a few days of working from home or using minimal makeup once the top layer has settled. If your work is very appearance-focused, we'll help you plan sessions around lighter weeks or holidays.",
