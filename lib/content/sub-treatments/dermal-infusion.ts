    intro:
      "Rough patches, old acne marks and makeup clinging to dry flakes? A Dermal Infusion facial (often known as SilkPeel or DiamondGlow) uses a diamond-tip handpiece with suction to gently sand away dead cells while infusing treatment serums at the same time.",

    sessions: "3-6 sessions, then maintenance",
    duration: "45-60 mins",

  overview:
    "Unlike basic microdermabrasion, Dermal Infusion combines diamond-tip exfoliation with controlled vacuum and targeted serums for pigmentation, acne or dryness. It can soften early acne scars, refine texture and improve product penetration without needles or heavy peeling.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your skin feels bumpy even though breakouts have settled",
    "Old acne marks and fine lines make your base look uneven",
    "You have stubborn roughness around the nose, chin or jawline",
    "You want texture improvement but are wary of strong lasers",
    "You have tried salon microdermabrasion but found it too harsh or ineffective",

        description:
          "We examine where your skin is rough, scarred or pigmented and discuss any past treatments like peels or lasers. You will be asked to avoid scrubs, waxing and home peels for a few days. Based on your concern, we choose serum options—for example, clarifying, hydrating or brightening.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Diamond-tip sweep with serum infusion",
        description:
          "The handpiece is moved across your face in passes. You will feel a mild, sandpaper-like buffing with suction as the tip removes dead cells and vacuums them away, while serums are delivered into freshly cleared channels. Most people find it very tolerable, with only brief sensitivity over bony areas.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Pink, polished skin",
        description:
          "Skin often looks slightly flushed and very smooth for a few hours, then settles with a refined, polished look. We apply soothing products and sunscreen and advise you to avoid hot water, vigorous exercise, scrubs and at-home exfoliants for around 3-5 days.",

    timeline:
      "You will notice smoother skin and a more even canvas immediately, with makeup going on more evenly. Over 3-6 sessions spaced a few weeks apart, many see softer fine lines, less roughness and a gradual improvement in mild acne marks and pigmentation.",
    recovery:
      "Expect mild redness and sensitivity for a few hours and possible light flaking over the next couple of days. Most people continue routine work the same day with gentle skincare.",

    {
      question: "Is Dermal Infusion safe for darker Indian skin tones?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when performed with appropriate pressure and passes, it can be used safely on Indian skin. Your dermatologist will avoid over-treating sensitive areas to reduce the risk of post-inflammatory pigmentation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can this replace stronger acne scar treatments?",
      answer:
        "It can help with early, shallow scars and texture but will not replace deeper treatments like microneedling RF or fractional lasers for significant scarring. Think of it as a step between basic facials and heavier procedures.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will there be visible peeling?",
      answer:
        "You may have mild dryness or flaking for a couple of days, but not sheets of peeling like with strong chemical peels. Keeping up with moisturiser helps.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I repeat Dermal Infusion?",
      answer:
        "For texture or pigmentation, we usually suggest a series every 3-4 weeks initially, then shift to maintenance based on how your skin responds.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it okay if I have a few active pimples?",
      answer:
        "A few small pimples are usually manageable—we simply work around them. If your acne is very inflamed, we may delay or switch to a calmer facial until it settles.",
    },
