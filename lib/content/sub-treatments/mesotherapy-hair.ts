    intro:
      "Mesotherapy for Hair delivers cocktails of vitamins, minerals, peptides and other actives through tiny injections into the superficial scalp. It supports follicles, especially when nutritional factors, stress or early thinning play a role alongside medical hair-loss treatment.",

    sessions: "6–8 sessions commonly used",
    duration: "Each session 20–40 minutes",
    downtime: "Tenderness, dots for days",
    painLevel: "Numbing, pinpricks, tolerable",
  },
  overview:
    "Using micro-needles, we place small amounts of tailored solutions across the scalp. Ingredients may include vitamins, amino acids and peptides that support scalp health and follicles, particularly when diet and stress have contributed to hair fall.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your tests show nutritional gaps and your diet is difficult to correct quickly.",
    "You want add-on scalp support along with standard hair-loss medicines.",
    "Hair thinning is early and diffuse, not shiny patches or scarring.",
    "You are comfortable with repeated small injections on the scalp surface.",
    "You understand benefit is supportive and gradual, not instant regrowth.",

        title: "Confirm role for mesotherapy",
        description:
          "We evaluate your hair diagnosis, review blood reports, diet and lifestyle, then decide whether mesotherapy meaningfully adds value. If yes, we plan actives, session number and spacing around your work and event calendar.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Deliver micro-dose injections",
        description:
          "After cleansing and numbing, we deliver micro-injections using fine needles or specialised devices across thinning areas. You may feel stinging or pressure, which usually reduces as the session continues and rhythm becomes familiar.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Integrate with wider plan",
        description:
          "You can usually resume routine activity quickly. We advise on washing, sun care and how mesotherapy fits with tablets, topical therapies, nutrition and stress-management steps in your broader hair-growth plan.",

    timeline:
      "Effects are typically subtle: reduced shedding and better hair feel over a few months, especially when combined with correcting nutritional gaps, medical treatment and realistic stress-management changes you can maintain.",
    recovery:
      "Scalp may feel tender, bumpy or mildly bruised for a few days. Gentle shampoo, sun protection and sleeping slightly elevated usually keep discomfort manageable while injections settle.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is mesotherapy enough without other treatments?",
      answer:
        "Usually no. It functions as support alongside medical therapies, nutrition and lifestyle correction. Using mesotherapy alone while ignoring underlying deficiencies or hormones rarely gives satisfying, durable improvement.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are mesotherapy cocktails the same everywhere?",
      answer:
        "No. Formulations differ by clinic and brand. We choose evidence-based combinations and adjust them to your scalp needs, allergies and concurrent treatments rather than relying on a one-size premix for everyone.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is mesotherapy painful despite numbing cream?",
      answer:
        "You will feel multiple pinpricks and pressure, but numbing, cooling and short breaks usually keep discomfort tolerable. We can modify technique or spacing if you find any segment particularly difficult.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many mesotherapy sessions are typical?",
      answer:
        "Many protocols begin with six to eight sessions, weekly or fortnightly, then extend gaps or stop depending on response. We review shedding, photographs and comfort regularly before advising whether to continue.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can mesotherapy be combined with PRP sessions?",
      answer:
        "Yes, in some plans we alternate or layer them, adjusting intensity so your scalp is not over-treated. The exact mix depends on diagnosis, budget, time and how your skin responds initially.",
    },
