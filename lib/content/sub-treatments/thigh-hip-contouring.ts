      "This treatment targets saddlebags, inner thighs and hipline bulges that rub, chafe or show through outfits, using body-contouring devices to refine leg and hip shape without surgery.",

    downtime: "Soreness, redness, rare bruises",

  overview:
    "We treat outer thighs, inner thighs and hipline with technologies that heat or disrupt fat cells and tighten skin slightly, aiming for smoother contour in jeans, ethnic wear and fitted athleisure.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your thighs rub painfully in humid weather or longer walks.",
    "Jeans or trousers fit at waist but cling around thighs.",
    "You feel saddlebags showing through kurtas or dresses.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Evaluate thigh pattern and gait",
        description:
          "We look at inner and outer thigh fat, hip dips, cellulite appearance and how you stand and walk, then decide which technologies and number of sessions are likely to show worthwhile, realistic change.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform device-based contour sessions",
        description:
          "Marked zones are treated with chosen devices using heat, suction or focused energy. We monitor your comfort and adjust passes so treatment feels intense enough to work but still manageable.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Advise posture and movement habits",
        description:
          "We suggest realistic walking, stretching and strength routines and discuss clothing, posture and sitting patterns so your daily habits support thigh contour changes instead of constantly working against them.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most people notice better comfort in jeans and reduced chafing over several sessions, with shape refinement building gradually rather than overnight.",
    recovery:
      "Tenderness, tightness or temporary lumps can appear; loose clothing, hydration and simple aftercare usually ease them.",

    {
      question: "Will thigh contouring help with cellulite dimples?",
      answer:
        "These treatments may soften the look of dimples but rarely remove cellulite completely. We explain likely improvement range and may combine technologies or skincare rather than promising perfectly smooth, airbrushed-looking thighs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I still exercise after sessions?",
      answer:
        "Light walking is usually encouraged soon after. We suggest delaying very intense workouts for a short time so soreness, swelling and device-treated tissues have space to settle comfortably.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many inches can I expect to lose?",
      answer:
        "Responses vary by genetics, lifestyle and starting shape. We avoid guaranteeing fixed inch numbers and instead track photographs, comfort, clothing fit and your own feedback over the treatment course.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is thigh contouring suitable after pregnancy?",
      answer:
        "Many people consider it after delivery once gynaecologist clears activity levels. We discuss breastfeeding, weight stability and medical history before planning any device work on thighs or hips.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can thigh contouring replace liposuction completely?",
      answer:
        "For mild to moderate pockets, non-surgical devices may be enough. For very large, hanging or complex fat deposits, we sometimes advise surgical opinions instead of promising results devices are unlikely to deliver.",
