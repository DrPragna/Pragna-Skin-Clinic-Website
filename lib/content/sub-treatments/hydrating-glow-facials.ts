    intro:
      "Skin feeling tight, tired or lifeless from travel, stress or strong actives? Hydrating & Glow facials are doctor-approved, non-device facials that focus on soothing, moisturising and gently brightening the skin barrier—more advanced than a parlour clean-up, but far gentler than peels or machines.",

  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Every 4–6 weeks or as needed",
    duration: "45–60 mins",
    downtime: "None; mild pinkness for 1–2 hours",
    painLevel: "Relaxing; mild tingling during active steps",
  },
  overview:
    "These facials use gentle cleansing, light enzyme or lactic acid exfoliation, massage, hydrating serums and cream or gel masks to restore comfort and glow. There are no vacuum devices or aggressive scrubs involved—the focus is on feeding and calming the skin, especially when you are on acne, pigmentation or anti-ageing treatment.",

    "Your skin feels dry, tight or \"stretched\" after starting retinoids or acne medicines",
    "You look dull and flat in the mirror even when breakouts are under control",
    "You want a facial that relaxes you but is still aligned with your dermat plan",
    "You often travel, work long hours or stay in AC and your skin shows it",
    "You are not ready for peels or devices yet, but want more than a basic clean-up",

        description:
          "We look at your current medicines and actives, check for irritation or flaking and ask about recent peels or procedures. Based on this, we decide how strong the exfoliation can be and what kind of mask and serums your skin can handle comfortably.",

        description:
          "After a thorough but mild cleanse, we may use a soft enzyme or low-strength acid step to loosen dead cells, followed by massage, hydrating serums and a cream or gel mask chosen for your skin type. The experience is meant to be relaxing—no harsh scrubbing or painful extractions.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Soft, comfortable glow",
        description:
          "Skin usually feels plumper and more comfortable straight away, with a healthy, rested look. We finish with moisturiser and sunscreen and guide you to avoid scrubs, home peels and very hot water for a couple of days so your barrier stays happy.",

    timeline:
      "You will see and feel a difference as soon as the facial is done—skin looks dewy rather than greasy and fine dryness lines appear softer. With regular sessions alongside the right home routine, many patients notice fewer \"bad skin days\" and better tolerance to treatment actives.",
    recovery:
      "There is essentially no downtime. Very sensitive skin may feel lightly warm or pink for a short time, which settles with moisturiser.",

      question: "How is this different from medifacials like Hydrafacial or Oxygeneo?",
      answer:
        "Hydrating & Glow facials are non-device treatments focused on comfort and barrier support. Medifacials like Hydrafacial or Oxygeneo use machines for deeper cleansing or oxygenation. We often use this facial when your skin needs a break from devices or stronger peels.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do this while I am on acne or pigmentation medicines?",
      answer:
        "Yes. These facials are often chosen specifically to offset dryness or irritation from treatment. We adjust products so they do not clash with your prescription creams or tablets.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will this clog my pores or cause breakouts?",
      answer:
        "We avoid heavy, comedogenic oils and thick massage creams in acne-prone skin. Products are chosen to hydrate without blocking pores, and we skip anything that feels heavy or occlusive for your skin type.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I book a Hydrating & Glow facial?",
      answer:
        "Many patients like doing this once every 4–6 weeks during active treatment phases, then less frequently once their skin is more stable. We will help you decide a rhythm based on your goals and schedule.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this just like a parlour facial?",
      answer:
        "No. While it feels relaxing, the products and steps are chosen by dermatologists to support your ongoing treatment, avoid irritating actives and keep your barrier healthy—without bleaching agents or random scrubs.",
