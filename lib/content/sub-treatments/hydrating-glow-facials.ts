      "Hydrating & Glow Facials focus on moisture, barrier repair and instant radiance. They are ideal before events or during stressful phases when your skin feels tight, lifeless or flaky from travel, air-conditioning or strong treatments.",

    sessions: "Often every four–six weeks",
    duration: "Roughly 45–60 minute sessions",

  overview:
    "These facials combine gentle exfoliation, hydrafacials, masks and hydrating serums to restore dewiness and comfort. They are particularly helpful when your barrier feels stressed from travel, screen-heavy work or active treatments like retinoids and peels.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your skin feels tight, dull or rough despite using moisturiser regularly.",
    "High AC, flights or night shifts leave your face looking tired and flat.",
    "You have a function, shoot or trip soon and want reliable glow.",
    "Strong actives like retinoids are making your skin flaky or uncomfortable.",
    "You prefer gentle facials because your skin reacts easily to harsh scrubs.",

        title: "Understand hydration needs",
        description:
          "We discuss your routine, travel, sleep, work stress and active treatments, then examine texture and dryness. This helps us decide how much exfoliation versus pure hydration your skin can comfortably handle that day.",

        title: "Deliver moisture-focused care",
        description:
          "We perform cleansing, mild exfoliation, hydrafacials, masks and serum infusions focused on moisture and plumpness. Massage and relaxation remain part of the experience, but product choices stay aligned with dermatologist guidance.",

    timeline:
      "Most people notice immediate softness and bounce, with makeup sitting better the same week. Regular sessions help stabilise your barrier so it copes better with weather changes, work travel and occasional stronger treatments.",
    recovery:
      "Hydrating facials rarely need downtime. Very sensitive skin may show brief pinkness, which usually settles within hours with moisturiser, cool compresses and gentle, fragrance-free products.",

    {
      question: "Are Hydrating & Glow Facials suitable for oily skin?",
      answer:
        "Yes, as long as products are chosen correctly. We avoid heavy creams and focus on water-based serums, light hydrafacial steps and masks that hydrate without clogging pores or triggering extra shine.",
    },
    {
      question: "How close to an event should I schedule this facial?",
      answer:
        "Many people like doing it three to seven days before functions. That window lets any minor pinkness settle while keeping glow and smoothness at their most noticeable for photos and meetings.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine Hydrating facials with chemical peels?",
      answer:
        "Often we alternate them. Hydrating facials support your barrier between stronger peels, improving comfort and results. Sometimes we blend mild exfoliation and hydration in one sitting, depending on your skin's recent reactions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will Hydrating facials make my skin dependent on them?",
      answer:
        "No. They give your barrier a boost and short-term glow. Good home routines keep skin stable between sessions, so facials feel like helpful extras, not something your skin collapses without.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are these facials safe during pregnancy?",
      answer:
        "Many hydrating steps are pregnancy-safe, but some actives and machines are avoided. We adjust protocols, focus on comfort and barrier repair, and coordinate with your gynaecologist if any medicine-related concerns arise.",
