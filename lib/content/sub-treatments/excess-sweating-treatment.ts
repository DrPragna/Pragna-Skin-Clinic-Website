      "Excess Sweating Treatment helps people with hyperhidrosis—sweating far beyond normal needs on palms, underarms, feet or face—using medical evaluation, topical care, medications and injectables to improve daily comfort.",

  overview:
    "We first confirm true hyperhidrosis and rule out medical causes. Treatment may include clinical antiperspirants, tablets, iontophoresis or botulinum toxin injections in sweat-prone areas, tailored to your lifestyle and health.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Sweaty palms interfere with handshakes, exams, paperwork or phone use.",
    "Underarm sweat soaks through clothes even in AC environments.",
    "Feet sweat and smell despite clean socks and regular washing.",
    "You change outfits or avoid colours purely because of sweat patches.",
    "You want structured, medical help, not just stronger deodorants.",

        title: "Diagnose and rule out triggers",
        description:
          "We ask when and where sweating appears, check family history, examine affected areas and may recommend tests to rule out thyroid, glucose, infections or medicines as underlying drivers.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Start targeted sweat control",
        description:
          "We begin with prescription antiperspirants and lifestyle steps, then consider tablets, iontophoresis or botulinum toxin injections where needed, explaining duration, cost, discomfort and realistic dryness levels.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Monitor function and comfort",
        description:
          "We track how sweating, daily activities and confidence change, watching for side-effects or compensatory sweating elsewhere. Plans are adjusted so control feels helpful but not unnaturally extreme.",

    timeline:
      "Topicals may help within weeks; injectables often show clear improvement within days to weeks and last several months before repeat sessions are considered.",

      "Topicals have little downtime. Injections may cause transient pain, bruising or weakness; we discuss this in detail before treatment.",

    {
      question: "Is excessive sweating purely due to hygiene issues?",
      answer:
        "No. Hyperhidrosis is often a nerve-sweat gland issue and can affect even very hygienic people. Good hygiene helps odour but usually cannot control true medical-level sweating alone.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are botulinum toxin injections safe for sweating?",
      answer:
        "When done correctly, they are a well-accepted option for underarms, palms and feet. We discuss risks like temporary weakness, discomfort and cost so you can decide calmly.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will treating sweat in one area worsen it elsewhere?",
      answer:
        "Some people notice sweating increasing at other sites, especially after certain procedures. We counsel about this possibility and choose options balancing benefit and this risk.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can home remedies cure hyperhidrosis?",
      answer:
        "Simple steps like breathable clothing, powders and stress management help but rarely cure true hyperhidrosis. Medical-grade treatments are often needed for meaningful improvement.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is surgery necessary for excessive sweating?",
      answer:
        "Surgery is usually a last resort. Many patients do well with medical treatments and injectables. If surgery is ever considered, we refer to appropriate specialists after detailed discussion.",
