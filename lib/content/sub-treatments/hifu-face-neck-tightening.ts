    tagline: "Lift without surgery",
    intro:
      "Jawline not as sharp as before? Mild jowls, heaviness around the mouth or a lax neck, but you don't want surgery yet? HIFU uses focused ultrasound energy to tighten deeper support layers of the skin, helping lift and contour the face and neck gradually with minimal downtime.",

  quickStats: {
    sessions: "1-3 sessions depending on laxity",
    duration: "45-90 mins (area-dependent)",
    downtime: "No true downtime; mild tenderness",
    painLevel: "Deep warmth and tingling",
  },
  overview:
    "HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound) targets precise depths under the skin, including the SMAS layer that surgeons work on in a facelift. It creates tiny coagulation points that trigger collagen production. Over the next few months, this tightening can improve jawline definition, double chin, lower face sagging and mild brow or neck droop.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You notice your jawline looks softer or 'melted' in photos compared to a few years ago",
    "You have mild to moderate sagging but don't feel ready for surgical lifting",
    "You want contouring for jawline, jowls or double chin with minimal interruption to work",
    "You're okay waiting a few months for results as long as it looks natural, not sudden",
    "You want a once-in-a-while treatment rather than very frequent sessions",

        title: "Mapping the lift zones",
        description:
          "We assess skin laxity, fat distribution and bone structure of your face and neck, and go through your medical history. Photos are taken to track change. Treatment areas—jawline, double chin, cheeks, brow or neck—are marked, and we explain what degree of lift is realistic for your age and skin quality.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Focused ultrasound pulses",
        description:
          "A conductive gel is applied and the HIFU handpiece is moved along the marked lines. You'll feel short bursts of heat or deep tingling each time the ultrasound focuses at a particular depth. Some areas like the jawline can feel more intense, but we adjust energy, spacing and breaks to keep you comfortable.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Gradual tightening phase",
        description:
          "Mild redness, swelling or tenderness to touch is common for a few hours to a few days. You can usually go back to work the same or next day. We advise gentle skincare, good sun protection and avoiding very hot facials or massage on the treated areas for about a week.",
      },

  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Many people notice a subtle 'snug' feeling or slight lift in the first few weeks as swelling settles. Collagen remodelling continues over 2-3 months, with best results typically around 3-6 months after treatment. Depending on age and lifestyle, results can last 12-18 months before a repeat session is considered.",
    recovery:
      "There is minimal social downtime. You may feel tender when chewing or touching certain points and, rarely, see mild bruising or numb patches, which usually settle on their own over days to weeks.",

    {
      question: "Is HIFU a replacement for a facelift?",
      answer:
        "No. HIFU is ideal for mild to moderate sagging and early jowls. It cannot match the result of a surgical facelift for very advanced laxity, but it can delay the need for surgery or enhance results when done at the right stage.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can HIFU melt facial fat and make me look gaunt?",
      answer:
        "When used correctly at appropriate depths and patterns, HIFU is aimed at tightening the supporting layers, not aggressively melting fat everywhere. We avoid high-energy passes over areas where you already have volume loss and focus on zones that benefit from tightening.",
    },
    {
      question: "How painful is HIFU and do I need anaesthesia?",
      answer:
        "Most people describe HIFU as deep heat with sharp, brief zaps in certain spots. It is tolerable but can be uncomfortable along the jawline and bony areas. Oral pain relief and numbing creams can be used to make the session easier.",
    },
    {
      question: "When is the best age to start HIFU?",
      answer:
        "It's less about age and more about laxity. Many patients start in their 30s or early 40s when they first notice jowls or a softer jawline. Earlier sessions on mild laxity often give more natural-looking, longer-lasting outcomes than waiting until sagging is severe.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is HIFU safe around the thyroid and nerves?",
      answer:
        "Treatment protocols are designed to avoid critical structures. We stay within safe zones, depths and energy limits for the neck and face. Temporary nerve irritation is rare but has been reported globally, so we use conservative, evidence-based parameters.",
