    intro:
      "Cheeks looking flatter, under-eyes hollow, or lips losing shape? Dermal fillers use soft, gel-like hyaluronic acid to gently restore volume, definition and structure in areas that have thinned or sagged, so your face looks fresher and better supported without obvious 'done' lines.",

  overview:
    "Modern hyaluronic acid fillers are designed to mimic the body's own support structures. Different consistencies are chosen for different jobs—firmer gels for jawline and chin contour, adaptable ones for cheeks and temples, and softer ones for lips or under-eyes. They integrate into tissue, attract water and can be dissolved if needed.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You feel you look tired even after good sleep because of hollows under the eyes",
    "Your cheeks or mid-face look flatter than before, making nasolabial lines stand out",
    "Your jawline and chin lack definition, especially in side-profile photos",
    "You want slightly fuller, more defined lips without an overdone look",
    "You prefer gradual, tweakable improvement over drastic, permanent changes",

        title: "Facial analysis and plan",
        description:
          "We study your face from multiple angles, assessing bone structure, fat loss, skin quality and symmetry. Medical history, blood thinners, autoimmune conditions and past filler treatments are discussed. Together we decide priority areas and how subtle or transformative you'd like the change to be.",

        title: "Filler placement with needle or cannula",
        description:
          "After numbing and antiseptic cleansing, filler is placed using fine needles or blunt-tipped cannulas depending on the area and safety considerations. You'll feel pressure, stretching and occasional sharp stings. We may show you the mirror mid-way to check you're comfortable with the direction we're going.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Shaping, settling and early care",
        description:
          "We gently mould and check the treated areas, then apply ice if needed. Expect some swelling, tenderness and possible bruising. You'll be asked to avoid heavy exercise, alcohol, facials, massages and pressing on the treated areas for a couple of days, and to sleep on your back if possible.",

    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "You'll see an immediate change in shape and volume, but the final result is clearer after 1-2 weeks once swelling reduces and filler integrates. Depending on the area, product and your metabolism, results usually last 9-18 months before a top-up or adjustment is needed.",
    recovery:
      "Most patients can resume light activities the same day, but visible swelling or bruising can last several days, especially around the lips and under-eyes. Planning treatments away from major events is wise.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will fillers make me look fake or overdone?",
      answer:
        "They don't have to. Overfilled or poorly placed filler creates that 'done' look most people fear. Our aim is to restore lost support and enhance your natural structure, not change your face completely. We prefer under-correction to over-correction and build gradually if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can dermal fillers be reversed if I don't like them?",
      answer:
        "Most modern fillers we use are hyaluronic acid based and can be dissolved with an enzyme called hyaluronidase if medically appropriate. This gives an added layer of safety and flexibility if an area needs adjustment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which areas can be treated with fillers?",
      answer:
        "Common areas include cheeks, under-eyes (tear troughs), lips, chin, jawline, temples and folds around the mouth. The exact plan depends on your anatomy—sometimes supporting the mid-face improves lower-face lines without filling them directly.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks I should be aware of?",
      answer:
        "Temporary swelling, bruising and lumps are common early on. More serious complications like vascular occlusion are rare but important to know about. We minimise risk with careful anatomy-based injection, using cannulas where appropriate and having reversal agents and emergency protocols in clinic.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon before an event should I get fillers done?",
      answer:
        "Ideally, schedule filler treatments at least 2-3 weeks before a big event. That allows time for swelling and bruising to settle and for us to make any minor adjustments, so you look your best when it matters.",
    },
