    intro:
      "Underarm Hair Reduction helps reduce coarse hair, repeated shaving cuts and darkness in the underarm area, giving smoother skin, easier hygiene and more confidence in sleeveless clothing.",

  overview:
    "We use triple-wavelength laser settings tailored to the underarm's thicker hair and sensitive skin. Over sessions, hair density drops, ingrowns reduce and deodorant, sweat and friction are easier to manage.",

    "Frequent shaving causes cuts, roughness and tiny underarm bumps.",
    "Waxing leaves redness, pain and lingering sensitivity after each visit.",
    "Ingrown hairs or boils are common in your underarm area.",
    "You feel conscious wearing sleeveless outfits or gym wear.",
    "Underarm darkness worsens each year with friction and hair removal.",

        title: "Deliver quick focused passes",
        description:
          "Clean, shaved underarms are covered with cooling gel, then treated with short laser passes. Each side usually takes only a few minutes while we monitor sensation and adjust energy as needed.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Soothe and support skin",
        description:
          "We advise fragrance-free moisturiser, gentler deodorant choices, avoiding hot waxing and scrubs, and keeping the area sweat-free for a short while. Future sessions are spaced to match visible regrowth.",

    timeline:
      "Regrowth often slows and feels finer within a few sessions. Most people notice easier shaving or less need for removal by the middle to end of their treatment plan.",
    recovery:
      "Redness, warmth or mild swelling may last for a few hours. Loose clothing and simple moisturiser usually keep you comfortable through the day.",

    {
      question: "Will laser also lighten my underarms?",
      answer:
        "Hair reduction reduces shadow and friction, which can help darkness indirectly. For pigment from past waxing or friction, we may suggest additional peels or creams if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is underarm laser safe with deodorant use?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but we ask you to skip strong deodorants on treatment day and for a short time after. Once the skin settles, gentle, non-irritating options can resume normally.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon can I work out after treatment?",
      answer:
        "We usually suggest avoiding very intense workouts or hot yoga for a day, so sweat and friction do not irritate freshly treated skin. Light activity is generally fine.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will hair stop smelling after laser?",
      answer:
        "Laser does not change sweat glands directly, but less dense hair can trap less sweat and bacteria. Many patients find odour easier to manage with reduced hair and proper hygiene.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need numbing cream for underarm sessions?",
      answer:
        "Most people manage without, thanks to cooling and quick passes. If you are very sensitive, we can use numbing cream in early sessions and taper as you get comfortable.",
    },
