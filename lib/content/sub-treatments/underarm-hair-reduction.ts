    intro: "Underarm hair can be tricky – frequent shaving and waxing often lead to in-grown hairs, darkening and irritation. Our laser-based underarm hair reduction targets the follicles directly, helping you achieve longer-lasting smoothness with minimal discomfort and downtime.",
    quickFacts: {

  isThisForYou: [
    "You shave or wax your underarms frequently and notice bumps, redness or dark patches.",
    "You prefer sleeveless clothing but feel conscious about underarm shadow or roughness.",
    "You're looking for a more convenient, dermatologist-supervised alternative to routine hair removal.",
    "You're okay with multiple sessions for a more lasting reduction in growth."

  howItWorks: {
    description: "A focused laser beam is passed over the underarm area, where the light is absorbed by pigment in the hair shaft and converted to heat, selectively disabling the hair follicles. Modern cooling technology and, when needed, topical numbing cream help keep the procedure comfortable.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Sessions are quick – usually a few minutes per underarm.",
      "Multiple sessions (typically 6–8) are scheduled to match the hair growth cycle.",
      "The treatment is suitable for most skin types; parameters are customised during consultation."
    ]
  },
  
  resultsAndRecovery: {
    description: "You may notice some hair shedding within 1–2 weeks after each session. With successive visits, regrowth becomes finer and sparser, and many patients see a marked reduction after 4–6 sittings.",
    points: [
      "Mild redness or swelling can occur, similar to a light sunburn, and usually settles within a few hours.",
      "We recommend avoiding waxing and plucking between sessions; shaving is usually allowed if needed.",
      "Occasional maintenance sessions may be advised to keep results stable in the long term."

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Will it darken my underarms?",
      a: "When done correctly with proper settings for your skin type, laser hair reduction typically improves darkening over time by eliminating the need for constant shaving and waxing, which can cause pigmentation."
    },
    {
      q: "How long should I avoid deodorant after treatment?",
      a: "We usually recommend avoiding deodorant for 24 hours after each session to prevent irritation. Your dermatologist will give you specific aftercare instructions."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I wax between sessions?",
      a: "No, waxing and plucking pull out the hair root, which the laser needs to target. Shaving is allowed if needed between sessions."
