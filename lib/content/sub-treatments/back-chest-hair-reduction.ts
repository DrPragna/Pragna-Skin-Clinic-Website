    intro:
      "Back & Chest Hair Reduction is popular among men and some women who struggle with dense torso hair, ingrowns, sweat trapping and difficulty reaching these areas for regular grooming.",

    sessions: "Commonly 6–8 sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 30–60 minutes",

  overview:
    "We treat upper and lower back, shoulders and chest using appropriate laser settings for thicker hair. Over sessions, hair density decreases, making hygiene, sports and aesthetics easier to manage.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Back or chest hair makes you conscious at pools, gyms or beach trips.",
    "Ingrowns, boils or folliculitis flare on sweaty back or chest skin.",
    "Shaving these areas is difficult and often leads to missed patches.",
    "Waxing is painful and hard to maintain because of regrowth speed.",
    "You want tidier torso hair for comfort rather than total smoothness.",

        title: "Examine density and skin",
        description:
          "We assess hair thickness, density, ingrowns and any active infections. Your occupation, sports, sweating patterns and shirt habits inform how we plan energy, spacing and aftercare.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Treat torso in sections",
        description:
          "Back and chest are shaved, cleaned and divided into zones. The laser passes systematically over each area with cooling, and we check sensation frequently because some sections are more sensitive than others.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Support healing and hygiene",
        description:
          "We advise breathable fabrics, regular but gentle cleansing, skipping heavy oils and avoiding gym or swimming for a short period. Follow-ups track reduction and any folliculitis change.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most people notice less dense regrowth and easier hygiene after several sessions. Over a full course, hair usually becomes patchier and finer, with maintenance as needed for long-term comfort.",
    recovery:
      "Temporary redness, heat or mild soreness can last for several hours. Simple care, breathable clothing and avoiding heavy sweating soon after treatment help skin settle quickly.",

    {
      question: "Is back and chest laser only for men?",
      answer:
        "No. While many men seek torso laser, some women with hormonal or genetic chest or back hair also benefit. Plans are fully customised irrespective of gender.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can laser help with recurrent back acne?",
      answer:
        "By reducing dense hair and friction, laser can indirectly help bacne in some people. We may still add separate acne treatments if active lesions or marks persist.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need someone to help shave my back?",
      answer:
        "Back shaving is tricky alone. You can get help at home or request in-clinic shaving before sessions. We only proceed once skin is clean and safely prepped.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will torso laser affect my muscles or organs?",
      answer:
        "No. The laser energy stays superficial, targeting hair follicles in the skin only. It does not reach muscles, lungs or other internal organs beneath the treated area.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long before beach holidays should I start?",
      answer:
        "Ideally a few months in advance so several sessions are completed and skin is stable. We also guide sun care so you can enjoy holidays without compromising results.",
    },
