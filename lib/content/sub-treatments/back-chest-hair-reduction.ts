    intro:
      "Shirts that never unbutton fully, avoiding swimming pools, or feeling awkward in fitted T-shirts often has a simple reason: dense hair on the chest or back. Laser hair reduction here helps you feel more at ease in your own skin.",

  overview:
    "These areas often have thicker, darker hair and larger surface area, especially in men. Using powerful yet controlled settings, we gradually thin out density so hair becomes lighter, more spaced out, and easier to manage - or barely noticeable at all.",

    "Shaving the back is impractical and waxing is painful",

        description:
          "The back and chest are examined for moles, acne, or previous scars so we can work around sensitive spots. Hair is clipped or shaved short before the session. You'll be advised to avoid strong actives or sunburn on these areas beforehand.",

        description:
          "You lie comfortably while the therapist moves the handpiece in a grid pattern across the chest or back. The sensation is of repeated hot snaps with a firm pressure from the applicator. Short breaks are offered as needed while we ensure no strip is missed.",

        title: "Sweat, Shower & Gym Guidelines",
        description:
          "We suggest skipping heavy workouts, very hot showers, and tight, synthetic fabrics for 24 hours to prevent irritation. A light, fragrance-free moisturiser and loose cotton clothing keep the skin calm while any redness settles.",

    timeline:
      "For many, hair becomes noticeably thinner and less dense after 3-4 sessions. By the end of a 6-8 session course, chest and back hair typically reduce to a much lighter, more manageable level, with occasional maintenance only if desired.",
    recovery:
      "The area can feel warm or mildly sunburn-like for a few hours. Most people return to desk work the same day, avoiding only sweat-heavy activities and very hot water briefly.",

      question: "Can laser help with back acne linked to hair and sweat?",
      answer:
        "Reducing hair can reduce friction and sweat trapping, which may indirectly help body acne. If you have active acne, we can combine laser with targeted acne treatments for best results.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need someone to help me shave my back before sessions?",
      answer:
        "If shaving the back is difficult at home, we can trim or shave the area at the clinic before lasering. Just let us know when booking so we can allow enough time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will chest hair look patchy if I stop midway?",
      answer:
        "If you discontinue early, there can be differences in density between treated and untreated areas. We therefore advise completing the planned course for a more even, natural-looking reduction.",
