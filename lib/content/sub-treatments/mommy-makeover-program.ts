      "The Mommy Makeover Program is a customised plan for mothers wanting safe, gradual improvement in tummy, hips, stretch marks and overall wellbeing—without crash diets, pressure or ignoring healing and mental health.",

    duration: "Visits 30–90 minutes each",

  overview:
    "We combine body-contouring devices, skin treatments for stretch marks or scars, wellness support and simple routines, coordinated with your gynaecologist when needed and paced around childcare, work and energy levels.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You feel disconnected from your post-pregnancy body and want supportive, non-judgmental guidance.",
    "Loose tummy, bulges or marks affect how you feel in everyday clothing.",
    "Sleep, feeding and work make strict gym or diet plans unrealistic.",
    "You want gentle shaping and skin work that respect breastfeeding and recovery.",
    "You prefer honest timelines instead of quick-fix \"back to pre-baby\" promises.",

          "We discuss deliveries, recovery, feeding, mood, support system and health, then examine tummy muscles, scars, fat pockets and stretch marks. Your gynaecologist's inputs are considered before suggesting any procedures.",

        title: "Support maintenance and kindness",
        description:

      question: "When can I start a Mommy Makeover after delivery?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on healing, breastfeeding, energy and doctor clearance. Some skincare and counselling start early; devices and stronger procedures wait until your body and gynaecologist signal readiness.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will this program erase all stretch marks and loose skin?",
      answer:
        "No. We aim to soften, tighten and blend, not erase every sign of pregnancy. Some marks and laxity will remain as part of your body's story; we focus on comfort and realism.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe while breastfeeding?",
      answer:
        "We choose or postpone treatments based on breastfeeding status and medicines. Many external treatments are safe; anything doubtful is delayed or modified after discussing with your gynaecologist.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does a Mommy Makeover mean surgery?",
      answer:
        "At PSC this program is predominantly non-surgical. If we feel you might benefit from surgical options, we share that gently and can refer, but we never push procedures you are not ready for.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I plan another pregnancy later?",
      answer:
        "We plan treatments and investments with that in mind, focusing more on comfort, posture, skin quality and realistic shaping rather than chasing perfection that might change with future pregnancies.",
    },
