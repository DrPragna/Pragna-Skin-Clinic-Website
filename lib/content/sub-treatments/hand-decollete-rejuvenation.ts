    intro:
      "This treatment improves thin, veiny hands and sun-damaged chest skin. We use peels, lasers, skin boosters, PRP and careful fillers where needed to restore smoother texture and healthier-looking tone in these often-neglected areas.",

  overview:
    "We treat pigment, crepe texture and volume loss using combinations of peels, laser toning, MNRF, PRP, boosters and fillers. Hands and chest then better match the fresher face you have worked on.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Assess damage and priorities",
        description:
          "We examine pigment, texture, veins and volume, ask about sun habits, driving and past treatments, then prioritise whether colour, crepe skin or hollowness bothers you most. This shapes which technologies we start with.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform resurfacing and volumising",
        description:
          "Depending on plan, we may do peels, laser toning, MNRF, PRP or microdroplet boosters, and sometimes subtle fillers for hands. Numbing and cooling are used generously to keep these sensitive areas comfortable.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Support with ongoing protection",
        description:
          "We emphasise daily sunscreen on hands and chest, plus simple habits like driving gloves or scarves. Maintenance sessions are planned based on how quickly pigment and crepe texture tend to return for you.",
      },

  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Colour and glow often improve within a few weeks of starting. Texture, veins and hollowness usually need several months and multiple modalities before hands and chest look comfortably in sync with your face.",
    recovery:
      "Redness, dots, swelling or bruises may show for some days. Light clothing choices, moisturiser and sun protection usually hide or minimise these while deeper repair continues quietly.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Why do my hands age faster than my face?",
      answer:
        "Hands get constant sun, soap and movement, often without sunscreen or care, so veins, pigment and thinning show earlier. Treating them brings overall appearance back into balance with your facial work.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will fillers in hands feel artificial or lumpy?",
      answer:
        "We use soft products, microdroplet placement and massage to spread filler evenly. Initial puffiness settles, and most people simply notice smoother backs of hands rather than any obvious implanted material.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I just do peels without injectables?",
      answer:
        "Yes, peels and lasers alone help colour and surface texture. However, pronounced hollowness or strong veins usually need boosters or fillers for best results; we explain pros and cons so you choose comfortably.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon after treatment can I drive?",
      answer:
        "You can usually drive immediately, though hands may feel tender for a day or two. We advise avoiding very heavy lifting or tight jewellery until swelling and soreness settle fully.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will these treatments stop new sun spots forming?",
      answer:
        "No treatment can fully outrun ongoing sun exposure. Procedures clear existing damage; daily sunscreen, physical cover and occasional maintenance help slow new spots so they build more slowly over time.",
    },
