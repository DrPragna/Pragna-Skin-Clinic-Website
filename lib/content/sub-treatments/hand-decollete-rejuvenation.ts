    intro:
      "Hands and the chest often reveal age before the face - sun spots, visible veins, fine lines and crepey skin. This treatment combines peels, fractional lasers, PRP/Profhilo, skin boosters and sometimes fillers to restore smoother texture, even tone and a softer, plumper look to these exposed areas.",

  overview:
    "For hands and decollete, we focus on reversing sun damage and boosting dermal support. Chemical peels and fractional lasers work on spots and texture, while PRP, Profhilo and skin boosters rehydrate and thicken the skin from within. Fillers can subtly mask prominent tendons or volume loss in very bony hands.",

        description:
          "We examine pigment, texture, thinning and volume loss on your hands and chest separately. Photos under normal and polarised light help map sun damage. Based on this, we plan the order of peels, lasers, PRP/Profhilo, skin boosters or fillers so that healing phases don't overlap too harshly.",

        description:
          "Mild-to-medium depth peels, fractional Erbium/CO2 or MNRF are used first to tackle spots and crepiness, creating a sensation of heat or prickling for a few minutes. PRP, Profhilo or skin boosters are injected as a grid of tiny blebs, and in selected patients, soft fillers are placed on the back of the hand to soften bony outlines and tendons.",

        description:
          "It's normal to see redness, dry patches and flaking or micro-crusting for a few days after peels or lasers. We give a simple routine with bland moisturisers, sun protection and clear 'do-not' rules. Hydration treatments continue to work silently over the next weeks as the skin thickens and brightens.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "Glow and brightness often improve after the first peel or laser session once flaking settles in 5-7 days. Texture and fine lines typically need 3-4 visits over a few months. Hydration and plumping from Profhilo, skin boosters or fillers become more obvious over 2-6 weeks and can last around a year.",
    recovery:
      "Hands and chest are easy to cover, but you should avoid intense sun, harsh detergents and heavy jewellery or tight straps while healing. Most daily activities can continue with some care.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will peels or lasers make my hands and chest more sensitive to sun?",
      answer:
        "During the healing phase, the skin is more delicate, so strict sunscreen and covering up are important. Once healed, the new skin can actually handle sun better if you maintain good protection, because pigment and texture are more even.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you treat prominent veins on the hands too?",
      answer:
        "We don't directly remove veins, but by improving skin thickness and adding subtle volume with fillers or boosters, the veins can look less stark. In very prominent cases, we may recommend seeing a vascular specialist for additional options.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon before a big event should I start?",
      answer:
        "If spots and texture are your main concern, it's best to start 2-3 months before a big event to allow for multiple sessions and full healing. For just hydration or mild plumping, a single Profhilo or booster session a few weeks before can still make a nice difference.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my hands look 'overdone' or swollen?",
      answer:
        "We favour subtle correction. The idea is not to make your hands look like someone else's, but to gently reduce bony prominence, soften lines and improve texture. We use light, spread-out filler and booster techniques to avoid a padded or 'pillowy' look.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to change my manicure or jewellery habits?",
      answer:
        "Immediately after procedures, you'll need to avoid harsh chemicals, tight bangles and heavy rings for a few days. In the long term, using gloves for household chemicals and daily sunscreen is far more important than specific nail or jewellery choices.",
