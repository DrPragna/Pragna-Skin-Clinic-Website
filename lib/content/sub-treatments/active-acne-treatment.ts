    intro:
      "Painful breakouts, whiteheads and sudden cysts can feel endless. Active Acne Treatment uses prescription care with supportive peels, hydrafacials or light-based sessions to calm inflammation, cut new pimples and protect your skin barrier.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Typically 3–6 month plan",
    duration: "Reviews every 4–8 weeks",
    downtime: "Mild redness after peels",

  overview:
    "We use a mix of lifestyle advice, prescription creams, tablets when needed and gentle in-clinic treatments like salicylic peels, hydrafacials or blue light to reduce lesion count, oiliness and pain while minimising fresh marks or irritation.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You get new, painful breakouts every week despite trying many over-the-counter products.",
    "Pimples flare around your periods, especially along the jawline and lower face.",
    "Past steroid or fairness creams helped briefly, then made acne and marks worse.",
    "You often squeeze or pick pimples and worry about scars later.",
    "You prefer a structured, doctor-guided plan instead of guessing each new month.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Consult, photos and plan",
        description:
          "We discuss history, triggers, medicines, skincare and periods, examine acne and marks and take photos. Then we outline medicines, clinic sessions and lifestyle tweaks, explaining timelines and likely side effects simply.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Start medicines and procedures",
        description:
          "You begin prescription creams, sometimes tablets, along with spaced peels, hydrafacials or light sessions if needed. Doses and gaps are adjusted depending on dryness, redness, mood changes or any other concerns you share.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Maintain and prevent relapses",
        description:
          "Once breakouts settle, we simplify to a maintenance routine with gentle cleansers, non-comedogenic products and sometimes low-dose medicines. Reviews become less frequent while we watch for triggers like stress, travel or missed doses.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most people notice fewer painful lesions and less oiliness within six to eight weeks. More stable control usually appears over three to six months, depending on hormones, stress and how consistently you follow the plan.",
    recovery:
      "Peels or light sessions may cause brief redness, dryness or flaking for a few days. With moisturiser and sunscreen, college, office and daily routines can usually continue normally.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will my acne worsen before it improves?",
      answer:
        "Sometimes adjustment to new creams or tablets brings small flare-ups or purging. We explain what is expected, stay reachable between visits and modify strength, frequency or combinations if your skin feels too irritated or uncomfortable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to stop makeup completely?",
      answer:
        "We usually pause heavy, occlusive makeup during flares and right after procedures. Non-comedogenic products can return gradually once your barrier calms, as long as you remove them gently and keep sunscreen as the non-negotiable step.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is isotretinoin compulsory for severe acne?",
      answer:
        "No. It is one strong option for scarring, resistant acne, not a default. We discuss benefits, monitoring and side effects in detail so you can decide together with your dermatologist whether it fits your situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I continue gym and outdoor sports?",
      answer:
        "Usually yes. We only ask you to avoid heavy sweating and sun right after procedures, wipe sweat gently instead of scrubbing and reapply sunscreen if you train outdoors during the day.",
    },
    {
      question: "When can we start treating acne scars?",
      answer:
        "Scar-focused sessions work best once new breakouts are fewer and inflammation is calmer. We usually wait until acne is reasonably stable, then begin subcision, microneedling or lasers in a planned sequence.",
    },
