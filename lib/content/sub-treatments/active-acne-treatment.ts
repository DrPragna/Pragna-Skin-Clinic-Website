        title: "Consultation & Skin Assessment",
        description: "We begin with a detailed history of your breakouts, skincare, lifestyle, and medications. Your dermatologist examines your skin to understand acne type and severity. You may be advised to stop certain harsh products, and we will keep your routine simple and easy to follow."

        phase: "during",
        title: "Customised Medical & In-Clinic Care",
        description: "Based on your assessment, we prescribe suitable creams or tablets and, where needed, add gentle in-clinic treatments such as acne facials, comedone extraction, or mild chemical peels. Procedures are done with proper hygiene and comfort measures, usually within 20-40 minutes."

    timeline: "Most people notice fewer new pimples and calmer skin within 4-6 weeks, especially when medicines and procedures are used regularly. Deeper acne and hormonal patterns may take a few months to stabilise, and marks or scars are addressed in later phases.",
    recovery: "Recovery is usually smooth, with only short-term redness, dryness, or mild peeling after some procedures. You can continue routine activities with good sun protection."

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How many sessions will I need for active acne?",
      answer: "Active acne is usually treated over 3-6 months, with review visits every 4-6 weeks. The exact number of visits depends on how severe your acne is, how your skin responds, and whether we need to adjust medicines over time."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I have to take oral medicines?",
      answer: "Not everyone needs tablets. Mild acne may respond well to creams and in-clinic procedures alone. For moderate to severe or hormonal acne, your dermatologist may suggest oral medicines and will explain the benefits, side effects, and monitoring clearly before starting."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the procedures painful?",
      answer: "Most acne procedures such as gentle peels and clean-ups cause only mild stinging, tingling, or warmth, which settles quickly. Where required, we use soothing products or cooling to keep you comfortable throughout."
    },
    {
      question: "Can acne be cured permanently?",
      answer: "Acne is influenced by hormones, skin type, and lifestyle, so it can flare again at times. However, with the right treatment and maintenance routine, breakouts can be reduced significantly and controlled long term, and the risk of scars and marks can be minimised."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to change my diet completely?",
      answer: "You usually don't need extreme diet changes. We may recommend simple tweaks like moderating high-sugar foods, dairy in some cases, and oily junk foods, along with managing stress and sleep. Your treatment plan will always be realistic and sustainable."
