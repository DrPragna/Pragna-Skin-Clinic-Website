    intro:
      "This treatment focuses on tummy and side bulges that resist diet and exercise, using body-contouring devices and protocols to support inch loss and smoother waistlines.",

    sessions: "Typically 6–8 planned sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 30–60 minutes",

  overview:
    "We use non-surgical body-contouring technologies to heat or mechanically target fat in the midsection. When combined with basic food and activity guidance, many people see improved fit around waistband, kurtas and occasional ethnic wear.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your lower belly and sides stay prominent despite reasonable weight control.",
    "Clothes fit at shoulders but feel tight or unflattering around waistline.",
    "You avoid fitted blouses or shirts because tummy outline bothers you.",
    "You want inch loss, not crash diets or unsafe slimming shortcuts.",
    "You are open to gradual device sessions plus modest lifestyle changes.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Assess core and waist area",
        description:
          "We examine fat thickness, skin quality, prior C-section scars and posture, review medical history and recent weight changes, then decide whether non-surgical contouring is suitable or if other medical evaluations should come first.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform targeted midsection sessions",
        description:
          "Marked tummy and flank areas are treated with chosen device, using controlled heat, suction or other energy. Cooling, monitoring and communication keep you comfortable while we deliver planned passes and track your tolerance carefully.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Support lifestyle and maintenance",
        description:
          "We suggest simple food, movement and hydration adjustments, discuss realistic timelines and clothing goals and plan review measurements so devices and lifestyle together create sustainable contouring rather than short-lived change.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most people notice better fit and slight inch loss after a few sessions, with clearer shaping appearing gradually over the full course when food and activity guidelines are followed.",
    recovery:
      "Soreness, warmth or mild bruises can occur for a day or two; simple aftercare usually keeps you comfortable.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will this replace regular exercise and diet?",
      answer:
        "No. These treatments support contouring but cannot override uncontrolled eating or inactivity. Best results appear when you maintain balanced food, movement and sleep; devices then help stubborn areas that resist even when overall habits are reasonable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is body contouring safe for everyone?",
      answer:
        "We avoid or modify treatments in pregnancy, uncontrolled thyroid, heart disease or hernia and carefully screen for clotting disorders, recent surgery and unrealistic expectations before suggesting any non-surgical shaping plan.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will the fat return after treatment?",
      answer:
        "Treated fat cells are less likely to return, but remaining cells can still enlarge if lifestyle changes are ignored, so we pair devices with realistic food, activity and weight-management guidance.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from weight loss?",
      answer:
        "These procedures target inch loss in specific pockets, not overall body weight. The weighing scale may change little while jeans, saree blouses or dresses fit more comfortably around treated areas.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine tummy shaping with other areas?",
      answer:
        "Often yes. We may plan tummy and flanks together, then thighs or arms later, depending on budget, health, device time and how much after-session soreness you are comfortable managing at once.",
    },
