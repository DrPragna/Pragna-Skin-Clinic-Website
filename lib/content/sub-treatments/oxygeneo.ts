    intro:
      "When your skin looks flat and sallow no matter what you apply, an Oxygeneo facial can help wake it up. It combines gentle exfoliation, CO2 micro-bubbles and nutrient infusion to trigger natural oxygenation from within and restore a fresher, brighter look.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "3-4 sessions, then maintenance",
    duration: "45-60 mins",
    downtime: "No downtime; mild warmth for a few hours",
    painLevel: "Fizzy, warm tingling on the skin",
  },
  overview:
    "Oxygeneo technology uses a reacting capsule and gel to create CO2 micro-bubbles on the surface, which prompts your body to draw oxygen-rich blood to the area (Bohr effect). Paired with mild exfoliation and serum infusion, it improves dullness, fine texture and mild uneven tone.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your face looks \"grey\" or drained even when you sleep well",
    "You have noticed early fine lines and loss of freshness around the mouth or eyes",
    "You want more radiance but are nervous about stronger peels",
    "You travel often and your skin looks tired from flights and AC",
    "You are looking for a pre-event facial that gives glow without flaking",

        title: "Skin review and capsule choice",
        description:
          "We assess your skin type, sensitivity and concerns—dullness, early ageing, mild pigmentation—and review any existing treatments. Based on that, we select the appropriate Oxygeneo capsule and gel combination (for brightening, hydration or anti-ageing) and ensure you have paused harsh scrubs or peels for a few days.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Exfoliate, oxygenate, infuse",
        description:
          "The Oxygeneo handpiece with a reacting capsule is moved over your skin with a matching gel. You will feel a warm, bubbly, effervescent sensation as CO2 micro-bubbles form and dissolve. This is followed by a soothing massage and targeted serum application to lock in hydration and radiance.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Soft, bright, event-ready skin",
        description:
          "Mild warmth or redness can linger for an hour or two, then settles into a fresher, more luminous look. We finish with moisturiser and sunscreen and guide you to avoid hot water, vigorous exercise and strong actives for the rest of the day.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "Many people notice a brighter, more \"awake\" complexion right after the session, with makeup sitting better over the next few days. A short series of 3-4 Oxygeneo facials, spaced a few weeks apart, can help maintain radiance and softer texture.",
    recovery:
      "No real downtime; you can step out the same day. Very sensitive skin may experience temporary pinkness or tightness, which usually resolves with gentle moisturiser.",

    {
      question: "Is Oxygeneo the same as an oxygen facial at a spa?",
      answer:
        "No. Spa oxygen facials usually blow pressurised oxygen onto the skin. Oxygeneo works by creating CO2 micro-bubbles that stimulate your body to bring more oxygen-rich blood to the area, while also exfoliating and infusing actives.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I peel after an Oxygeneo facial?",
      answer:
        "Visible peeling is uncommon. The exfoliation is designed to be controlled and comfortable. If your skin is already very dry or flaky from other treatments, we may adjust the intensity.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine Oxygeneo with other treatments?",
      answer:
        "Often yes. It can be scheduled between peel or laser sessions to support glow and comfort. The exact timing depends on what else you are doing; your dermatologist will map this out for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it suitable for sensitive or rosacea-prone skin?",
      answer:
        "In some sensitive skins we can use a gentler protocol, but if you have active rosacea flares or very reactive skin, we may choose a different facial or focus on calming treatments first.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon before an event should I book it?",
      answer:
        "Most people are event-ready the same day or the next day. If it is your first time, doing a trial at least 2-3 weeks before a major event is a good idea.",
    },
