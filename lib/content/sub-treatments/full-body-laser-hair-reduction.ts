    intro:
      "Full Body Laser Hair Reduction treats major body areas in planned sessions, so you can steadily move away from constant waxing, threading or shaving and enjoy overall smoother, more manageable skin.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Typically 6–8 core sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 2–3 hours",
    downtime: "Mild redness, short-lived warmth",
    painLevel: "Snapping, tolerable with cooling",
  },
  overview:
    "We cover arms, legs, underarms, bikini area, back, chest and other agreed zones in one coordinated plan. Energy settings, passes and intervals are fine-tuned for each area to balance comfort, speed and effective hair reduction.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You keep multiple waxing, threading and shaving appointments every month.",
    "You want long-term reduction instead of repeated full body parlour visits.",
    "Ingrowns, cuts or rashes are common after your regular hair removal methods.",
    "You are okay committing time for longer, carefully planned laser sessions.",
    "You prefer one structured plan instead of tackling each area randomly.",

        title: "Consult and patch testing",
        description:
          "We map all chosen areas, assess hair and skin, check medical history and medicines, then perform patch tests on key zones. Shaving guidance, sun rules and session scheduling are shared before the first full body appointment.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Sequential full body sessions",
        description:
          "On treatment day, shaved skin is cleaned and gel applied. The diode handpiece passes over each section with cooling. We monitor comfort constantly, adjusting energy and pace while ensuring consistent coverage everywhere.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Soothe skin and plan cycles",
        description:
          "Post-care includes soothing creams, cool compresses and clear sun instructions. We schedule subsequent sessions to match hair cycles of face and body, then shift you to maintenance once reduction stabilises.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Many people notice slower, finer regrowth after two to three sessions. Visible reduction usually builds over six to eight sessions, then occasional maintenance helps keep results steady.",
    recovery:
      "Redness, warmth or mild swelling can last a few hours to a day. With loose clothing, moisturiser and sunscreen, work and routine activities can generally continue as normal.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Do I need to stop waxing before full body laser?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We switch you from waxing or threading to shaving before and between sessions, because waxing removes the hair root that the laser needs to target effectively in each growth cycle.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is full body laser hair reduction safe in one sitting?",
      answer:
        "When done with proper machines, patch tests and protocols, it is generally safe. We pace sessions, ensure hydration and cooling and may split very large areas over days if your skin needs gentler pacing.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will all my body hair disappear permanently?",
      answer:
        "Laser gives long-term reduction, not absolute removal. Coarse hair usually becomes sparser and finer. Some regrowth is expected; maintenance sessions at longer gaps help keep results over the years.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can men also opt for full body laser?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We treat many men for chest, back, arms, legs and other areas. Settings differ because male hair is often denser and coarser, but the same safety and planning principles apply.",
    },
    {
      question: "How should I prepare on treatment day?",
      answer:
        "Arrive with skin freshly shaved, clean and free from heavy creams, oils or perfumes. Avoid strong sun, parlour treatments and active products on treated areas in the days just before your session.",
    },
  ],
