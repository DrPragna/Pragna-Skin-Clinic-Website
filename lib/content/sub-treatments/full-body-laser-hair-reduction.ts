  overview:
    "This treatment combines multiple areas - such as arms, legs, underarms, bikini line, back, and face where needed - into a single long-term plan. Using diode and Alexandrite laser settings adjusted per area, we aim for 80-90% long-term hair reduction over a full course.",

        description:
          "We first decide which areas to include and in what order, keeping your pain tolerance and schedule in mind. You'll be asked to shave (not wax) the included areas 24 hours before, avoid heavy tanning, and skip strong actives or scrubs for a few days.",

        title: "Area-Wise Laser Passes",
        description:
          "A cooling gel is applied where needed. The therapist works area by area - for example legs, then arms, then underarms and bikini. You'll feel hot pinpricks or snapping sensations that last for seconds at a time, with short breaks between areas. The full session can take 1-2 hours.",
      },

        phase: "after",
        title: "Same-Day Routine, smarter aftercare",
        description:
          "Expect mild redness or warmth, especially on larger areas, for a few hours. Loose cotton clothing is best on the day of treatment. We ask you to skip hot showers, saunas, and gym for 24 hours, moisturise dry areas, and keep strict sun protection on exposed skin.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "After the first couple of sessions, you'll usually notice slower regrowth and softer hair. By session 3-4, gaps in growth appear and shaving frequency drops. Completing 6-8 well-timed sessions typically gives 80-90% long-term reduction, with occasional maintenance if needed.",
    recovery:
      "Most people return to routine the same day. Any redness or warmth settles within a few hours; sensitive areas may feel sunburn-like for a short time but cool compresses and moisturisers usually help.",

    {
      question: "Do I have to treat the entire body in every session?",
      answer:
        "Not necessarily. Many people split full body into 2-3 logical zones to match their comfort, budget, and time. We'll create a sequence so that all chosen areas complete their 6-8 sessions without overloading any single visit.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I still wax or thread between sessions?",
      answer:
        "Waxing and threading are not recommended, as they remove the root that the laser needs to target. You can shave between sessions if you'd like - it won't affect the laser result.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is full body laser safe if I travel to sunny places often?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but we'll plan around your travel. You'll need stronger sun protection, and sessions may be spaced a bit more if you've had recent intense sun exposure or tanning.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I only want some areas right now and add more later?",
      answer:
        "You can absolutely start with priority areas - for example underarms and legs - and add other regions once you're comfortable. We'll time additional areas so your overall plan still makes sense.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I be completely hair-free everywhere?",
      answer:
        "The realistic goal is long-term, major reduction. Most people see very fine, light hair left in some places, which is far easier to manage. We avoid promising a 'zero hair' outcome because everyone's growth pattern is different.",
    },
