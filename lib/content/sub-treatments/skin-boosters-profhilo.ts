    intro:
      "Skin Boosters & Profhilo use injectable hyaluronic acid in microdroplets to deeply hydrate, improve elasticity and smooth fine lines. They work on overall skin quality, not facial shape, giving a healthy, light-reflecting glow.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Typically 2–3 starter sessions",
    duration: "Around 30–45 minutes each",
    downtime: "Bumps, bruises for days",
    painLevel: "Numbing, pinpricks, tolerable",
  },
  overview:
    "Ultra-pure hyaluronic acid is placed just under the skin using fine needles or cannulas. It spreads over days, drawing water, improving elasticity and texture, especially on crepey cheeks, neck, hands or other frequently exposed areas.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your skin looks dry and tired even when acne or pigmentation are controlled.",
    "Fine lines and crepe texture bother you more than deep wrinkles currently.",
    "You want injectable glow but do not want to change facial shape.",
    "You are okay with tiny bumps and mild bruises for a few days.",
    "You prefer subtle radiance that photographs well rather than obvious volume.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Assess areas and safety",
        description:
          "We assess skin quality, laxity and ongoing treatments, discuss areas like face, neck or hands, and confirm no medical reasons to avoid injections. Photos help track hydration and texture changes over time.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Place microdroplet injections",
        description:
          "After numbing, we inject tiny droplets or linear threads of product at planned points. You may see small bumps or feel stinging, which settle as the hyaluronic acid spreads and draws water.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Support integration and maintenance",
        description:
          "We advise on sleeping position, exercise, medicines and when to resume actives. Over the next weeks, skin usually feels bouncier and better hydrated; top-up sessions lock in longer-lasting quality.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Initial plumpness may be visible within days, with best quality improvements over four to eight weeks. A basic course of two to three sessions often holds for several months before gentle maintenance is considered.",
    recovery:
      "Temporary bumps, redness or bruises are common for some days, especially under eyes or on hands. Most people work normally, using mild cover-up once injection points close.",

    {
      question: "How are Skin Boosters different from fillers?",
      answer:
        "Boosters are softer, spreadable gels placed superficially for hydration and texture, not sculpting. Fillers are thicker, placed deeper to change contours. Sometimes they are combined; other times boosters alone give enough glow.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do Skin Boosters and Profhilo results last?",
      answer:
        "Most people repeat a starter course of two to three sessions, then consider maintenance every six to twelve months, depending on age, lifestyle, sun exposure and how their skin feels as product wears off.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are Skin Boosters safe for acne-prone skin?",
      answer:
        "We avoid injecting through active cystic lesions and choose placements carefully. For many adults with old acne and new dryness, boosters actually help barrier repair, but decisions are made case by case.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do Skin Boosters before a big event?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but timing matters. We prefer completing main injections a few weeks before, then doing only light touch-ups closer to the date so bumps and bruises have fully settled.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are Skin Boosters painful compared to peels or lasers?",
      answer:
        "Discomfort feels different rather than stronger. Numbing reduces needle sting, while peels or lasers cause more surface burning. Most patients find boosters very manageable with proper preparation and clear expectations.",
    },
