    {
      question: "When can I safely start post-pregnancy body treatments?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on delivery type, healing, breastfeeding and medical clearance. We often wait several weeks or months, then coordinate with your gynaecologist to introduce only what your body can handle gently.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will these treatments affect breastfeeding or milk supply?",
      answer:
        "Most external devices do not directly affect lactation, but we choose technologies, timing and medicines cautiously. Whenever doubt exists, we defer or modify treatment until your gynaecologist confirms comfort and safety.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can body shaping erase all stretch marks and loose skin?",
      answer:
        "No. We can improve texture, colour and support using devices and creams, but some stretch marks and laxity are part of normal postpartum change; our role is to soften, not erase every sign.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I feel guilty focusing on my body?",
      answer:
        "Many new mothers feel conflicted. Our space is judgment-free; we pace plans gently, frame goals around comfort and confidence, and always prioritise mental health and medical safety over any aesthetic target.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to reach pre-pregnancy weight first?",
      answer:
        "Not always. We look at health, energy, support and emotional readiness more than a specific number on the scale, and may work alongside nutrition or physiotherapy when useful.",
