      "Need skin that looks polished and photo-ready without risking a peel? The ZO Red-Carpet Facial uses ZO Skin Health's stimulator peel, enzymes and brightening serums to smooth texture and boost radiance with virtually no visible peeling.",

  overview:
    "This protocol pairs a low-downtime AHA-based stimulator peel with exfoliating enzymes, masks and antioxidant serums. It is ideal before shoots, functions or important meetings where you want refined texture, softer fine lines and a more even, luminous tone.",

    "You want a \"red carpet\" glow before a big event",
    "Your skin looks uneven under makeup with fine bumps and dry areas",
    "You are not ready for strong peels that cause obvious shedding",
    "You already use ZO or similar actives and want an in-clinic boost",

        description:
          "We review your current skincare, especially any acids or retinoids, and examine your skin for dryness or irritation. If needed, we ask you to pause certain actives before the facial. Sensitive skins may get a quick test patch of the peel to judge comfort.",

        title: "Cleanse, ZO stimulator peel, mask and serums",
        description:
          "After cleansing and prepping the skin, the ZO stimulator peel is applied in a thin layer. You will feel a warm tingling for a few minutes while it works, then it is neutralised. This is followed by a soothing or brightening mask and layered ZO serums to hydrate and enhance glow.",

        title: "Subtle peel, strong polish",
        description:
          "Most people leave slightly pink with skin feeling smoother and tighter. Any flaking that occurs tends to be light and can show up over the next 2-3 days. We give you clear instructions on which home products to pause and when to restart them.",

      "Skin usually looks fresher and more refined within 24 hours, with makeup applying more evenly. A short series before an important season—like wedding events or a busy social period—can boost overall tone and texture.",
    recovery:
      "Expect minimal disruption: transient warmth, mild redness and possibly a bit of fine flaking. Heavy peeling or rawness is not expected; if your skin tends to overreact, we will adjust or choose another option.",

    {
      question: "Will I peel visibly after the ZO Red-Carpet Facial?",
      answer:
        "Most people experience either no peeling or just fine, mild flaking that is easy to manage with moisturiser. It is designed as a low-downtime protocol suitable close to events.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe if I am already using acids or retinoids at home?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but we may guide you to pause them a few days before and after to avoid over-exfoliation. Be honest about everything you are using so we can tailor the plan safely.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon before my event should I schedule it?",
      answer:
        "Ideally 3-5 days before a big event, especially if it is your first time. This gives your skin time to settle into its best glow.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this facial only for people on ZO skincare?",
      answer:
        "No. You can benefit from this protocol even if you are not using ZO products at home, though results can be further supported if your daily routine is optimised.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can this replace stronger pigmentation or anti-ageing treatments?",
      answer:
        "It helps with radiance and fine texture, but will not replace deeper treatments like targeted pigment peels, lasers or injectables for significant concerns. We will guide you on what role it can realistically play.",
