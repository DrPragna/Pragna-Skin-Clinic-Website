    intro:
      "Signature Medifacials are doctor-designed facial treatments that go beyond scrub and bleach. They combine cleansing, gentle exfoliation, hydrafacials, masks and serums chosen for your skin goals, ongoing medicines and upcoming events.",

  overview:
    "We customise each medifacial to your acne, pigmentation or ageing concerns. Steps can include cleansing, exfoliation, hydrafacials, extractions when required and masks, giving more effective results than parlour facials while still feeling relaxing and camera-friendly.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You want facials designed around dermatology advice, not just a parlour menu.",
    "Your skin often breaks out or burns after regular salon or bleach-based facials.",
    "You are already on acne, pigment or anti-ageing treatments and need compatible facials.",
    "You like monthly self-care rituals but also want real, medically planned results.",
    "You are preparing for weddings, shoots or events and want dependable, predictable glow.",

        description:
          "We check your skin type, medications, current routine and upcoming functions, then choose a protocol. This decides how much exfoliation, hydration and brightening you can safely handle in that session without irritation.",

    timeline:
      "Many people notice softer, cleaner-feeling skin and better makeup sitting after the first session. Deeper improvements in texture and balance usually build over several months of regular, correctly spaced medifacials.",
    recovery:
      "Most sessions have no visible downtime beyond brief pinkness. Rarely, extractions or peels cause mild flaking or spots, which we discuss before treatment so you can schedule confidently.",

    {
      question: "How are Signature Medifacials different from salon facials?",
      answer:
        "Salon facials often rely on fixed menus, bleach and fragrance. Signature Medifacials use medical-grade products, hygiene protocols and dermatologist planning, so steps, actives and frequency match your actual skin diagnosis and ongoing treatments.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take a Medifacial during acne or pigmentation treatment?",
      answer:
        "Often yes. We simply design protocols that support, not irritate, your treatment plan—avoiding harsh steaming, aggressive scrubs and comedogenic oils while still giving cleansing, mild exfoliation, hydration and calming steps.",
    },
    {
      question: "How frequently should I repeat Signature Medifacials?",
      answer:
        "Many people like monthly sessions; others prefer every six to eight weeks. We suggest a frequency based on your skin needs, budget, schedule and any stronger procedures planned in between.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Medifacials replace my home skincare routine?",
      answer:
        "No. Facials are boosters. Daily cleansing, moisturiser and sunscreen still carry most of the workload. Medifacials help reset skin and complement your routine, but cannot compensate for skipping basics every day.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there any age limit for Signature Medifacials?",
      answer:
        "Not really. Protocols just change with age and concerns. Teenagers may need acne-friendly versions, while older patients benefit more from hydrating, firming or pigment-focused combinations under dermatologist guidance.",
    },
