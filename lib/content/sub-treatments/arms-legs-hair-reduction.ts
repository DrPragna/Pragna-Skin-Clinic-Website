  overview:
    "We use sweeping laser passes with cooling to cover full arms, forearms, thighs or full legs. Over time, hair becomes finer and regrowth slower, making grooming simple and less frequent.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You often avoid short sleeves or dresses because of arm or leg hair.",
    "Waxing large areas feels painful and leaves leftover sticky patches.",
    "Shaving causes nicks, dryness or rough stubble within a day or two.",
    "Ingrowns or folliculitis appear on calves, thighs or forearms.",
    "You want smoother limbs for comfort, sports or special occasions.",

        title: "Plan coverage and sessions",
        description:
          "We decide which sections to treat—full arms, legs or specific parts—then assess hair thickness and density. This guides energy, number of passes and appointment durations that fit your schedule.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform large-area passes",
        description:
          "After shaving and gel application, the laser head glides in overlapping lines along arms and legs. Built-in cooling helps keep warmth manageable while we ensure thorough coverage without gaps.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Care for large treated areas",
        description:
          "We recommend moisturiser, sunscreen and avoiding harsh scrubs or hot waxing. Follow-up timings are adjusted based on how quickly different zones show visible regrowth between sessions.",
      },

  results: {
    timeline:
      "You may see slower regrowth and softer hair after a few sessions. Noticeable reduction in density typically develops over the full course of treatments and stabilises with occasional maintenance.",
    recovery:
      "Mild redness or heat sensation can last for some hours. Comfortable clothing, hydration and emollients usually keep skin settled through the day.",

    {
      question: "Can I treat only forearms or lower legs?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Arms and legs can be treated in sections if you prefer. We tailor plans based on your clothing choices, budget and which areas trouble you most.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will laser help with strawberry legs?",
      answer:
        "By reducing hair and follicle inflammation, laser often improves the dotted look called strawberry legs. Additional peels or skincare may be suggested for best texture change.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it okay to tan during treatment?",
      answer:
        "Fresh tan increases risk of irritation and pigment changes. We suggest sun protection and avoiding intentional tanning so settings can remain both effective and safe.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can athletes and swimmers benefit from laser?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Many athletes, dancers and swimmers choose laser for comfort and convenience. Smoother skin reduces chafing and frequent last-minute hair removal before events.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will results differ on arms and legs?",
      answer:
        "Yes, because hair thickness and cycles vary. Calves may respond faster than thighs; forearms differently from upper arms. We monitor each zone and adjust expectations and sessions accordingly.",
    },
