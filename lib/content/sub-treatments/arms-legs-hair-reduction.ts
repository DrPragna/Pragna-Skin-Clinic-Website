    tagline: "Smooth skin, fewer razor days",
    intro:
      "Full-sleeve tops in summer and hesitation about skirts or shorts often come down to one thing: visible hair on arms and legs. Laser hair reduction in these areas helps you move away from constant waxing and last-minute shaving.",

  quickStats: {
    sessions: "6-8 sessions, 4-6 weeks apart",
    duration: "30-90 mins depending on areas",
    downtime: "Mild redness for a few hours",
    painLevel: "Rhythmic snaps + cooling rolls",
  },
  overview:
    "We treat forearms, full arms, lower legs, or full legs based on what you choose. Larger areas allow broader passes with diode or Alexandrite lasers, meaning sessions are efficient and progress is easy to notice in daily life.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You plan outfits around when you last waxed or shaved your arms and legs",
    "Razor nicks and cuts are common, especially around knees and ankles",
    "Your hair feels coarse even a day or two after waxing",
    "You want long-term smoothness, not just for festivals or vacations",
    "You're okay with investing time across several months for a big payoff",

        title: "Shaving & Sun Rules",
        description:
          "You'll be asked to shave the chosen areas 24-48 hours before your session. Tanning beds and intense sun should be avoided beforehand, and moisturisers or oils are skipped on the day so the laser can work evenly.",
      },

        phase: "during",
        title: "Longer, Rhythmic Laser Passes",
        description:
          "Working in sections, the therapist glides the handpiece over the arms and legs in overlapping strokes. You feel repeated warm snaps, like an elastic lightly flicking the skin, along with cool sensations from the device tip or gel. Time depends on how many regions you include.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Post-Session Comfort & Clothing",
        description:
          "The skin may look slightly flushed, especially around bony areas like shins and knees. We suggest loose, breathable clothing and avoiding hot showers, harsh scrubs, or waxing. A bland moisturiser and sunscreen on exposed areas support recovery.",

    timeline:
      "By the second or third session, many people notice they can go longer between shaves or feel less stubble. Over the full 6-8 session plan, hair becomes patchy, finer, and significantly reduced, making arms and legs much easier to maintain.",
    recovery:
      "Mild redness usually disappears within a few hours. Most people resume regular work and errands immediately, with only exercise and heat-heavy activities restricted for a day.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will knees and elbows need extra attention?",
      answer:
        "Yes, areas with curves and bony points are given extra passes and careful energy control to ensure full coverage without overheating. We pay special attention to these zones each time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I tan or go to the beach during my treatment course?",
      answer:
        "You can, but we'll ask you to protect the treated areas carefully and may adjust or delay sessions after intense sun exposure to keep skin safe.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it better to do arms and legs together or separately?",
      answer:
        "That depends on your time, pain tolerance, and budget. Some prefer shorter, more frequent visits treating one region at a time; others like doing both in a single sitting. We can plan either way.",
    },
