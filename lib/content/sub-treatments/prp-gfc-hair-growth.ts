    tagline: "Use your growth factors",
    intro:
      "PRP / GFC for Hair Growth uses concentrated platelets and growth factors from your own blood, injected into thinning areas of the scalp. It supports existing follicles, improving hair calibre and reducing shedding when combined with medical hair-loss treatment.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "3–6 sessions over months",
    duration: "Each session 45–90 minutes",
    downtime: "Tenderness, swelling a few days",
    painLevel: "Numbing, injections, tolerable",
  },
  overview:
    "A small amount of blood is processed to concentrate platelets and growth factors, then injected across thinning scalp zones. These signals support follicles, especially in early to moderate loss, and work best alongside topical and oral hair-loss medicines.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your dermatologist has diagnosed pattern loss and advised medical treatment already.",
    "You want to add non-surgical procedures that use your own blood components.",
    "Thinning is mild to moderate, not completely bald or shiny areas.",
    "You can spare time for repeated sessions and follow post-procedure instructions honestly.",
    "You understand PRP supports, not replaces, everyday hair-loss medicines and lifestyle changes.",

        title: "Plan and prepare treatment",
        description:
          "We confirm suitability, review medicines, check blood tests if needed and explain realistic expectations. On procedure day, we draw blood, prepare PRP or GFC in sterile conditions and mark thinning zones to ensure even coverage.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Inject growth-factor solution",
        description:
          "After numbing cream and sometimes injections, we place small PRP or GFC deposits across the scalp using fine needles. You may feel pressure or stinging, which usually becomes tolerable as the session progresses.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Guide recovery and review",
        description:
          "You can usually go home shortly after. We advise on washing, exercise, medicines and when to resume styling. Sessions are spaced weeks apart; we track shedding, texture and photos to judge benefit.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most patients notice reduction in shedding and improved hair feel by two to three sessions, with calibre and density changes taking several months when combined with consistent medical therapy.",
    recovery:
      "Scalp may feel tender, heavy or mildly swollen for a day or two. Small bruises or headache are possible; simple pain relief and sleep adjustments usually keep you comfortable.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is PRP or GFC better for hair?",
      answer:
        "Both aim to deliver concentrated growth factors; differences relate to preparation and stability. We suggest an option based on your medical history, expectations, budget and what integrates best with your broader hair-loss plan.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can PRP regrow hair on completely bald patches?",
      answer:
        "PRP works best where follicles still exist but are weakened. On shiny, fully bald areas, expectations are limited; we may discuss camouflage, transplant or purely maintenance approaches instead of promising dense regrowth.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is PRP very painful even with numbing?",
      answer:
        "Discomfort varies, but numbing cream, cooling and small syringes keep it manageable for most people. We pace injections, offer short breaks and adjust technique if you find any phase difficult.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many PRP sessions will I need?",
      answer:
        "Common protocols use three to six sessions spaced weeks apart, followed by occasional maintenance if you respond well. We individualise schedules based on cause, response, finances and how much time you can realistically give.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I wash or colour hair after PRP?",
      answer:
        "We usually suggest avoiding washing for a short period, then resuming gentle shampoo. Colouring or strong chemical treatments are better delayed until initial healing settles; we give you precise timelines after each session.",
    },
