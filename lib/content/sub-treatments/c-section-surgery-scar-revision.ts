    intro:
      "C-Section & Surgery Scar Revision focuses on scars that healed but remain raised, wide, dark or itchy. We use lasers, microneedling, injections and medical creams to gradually refine texture and colour where safely possible.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Usually 3–8 treatment sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 20–45 minutes",
    downtime: "Redness, dots, mild soreness",
    painLevel: "Pinpricks, stinging, tolerable",

  overview:
    "We work on C-section, appendix, gallbladder or other surgical scars once healing is stable. Treatment combines fractional lasers, MNRF, silicone gels, peels and sometimes steroid injections for thick scars, tailored to your skin and surgery history.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your C-section scar feels darker, thicker or uneven years after delivery.",
    "Old surgery scars show through blouses, sarees or swimwear uncomfortably.",
    "Scar areas itch, feel tight or catch on waistbands and clothing seams.",
    "You worry about treating scars because your skin often leaves dark marks.",
    "You want improvement while still respecting what the scar represents.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Review surgery and healing",
        description:
          "We review operation notes where possible, ask about healing, infections or stitch issues, examine scar thickness and colour and assess keloid tendency before deciding suitable modalities and timings for your scar type.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Combine targeted scar treatments",
        description:
          "Depending on the scar, we may use fractional lasers, microneedling, steroid injections for raised parts, peels for colour and silicone-based protocols. Sessions are brief but repeated, with energy and depth adjusted each time.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Support scar remodelling at home",
        description:
          "We recommend massage, silicone gels or sheets, sun protection, clothing adjustments and realistic timelines, then review early to catch any thickening, darkening or discomfort so plans can be promptly modified.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Scars remodel slowly; improvements in itch, tightness and colour often appear before major shape change. Multiple sessions over months are common, especially for older or thicker scars.",
    recovery:
      "Temporary redness, sensitivity or tiny crusts can form; gentle care, loose fabrics and sun protection usually keep the area comfortable while new collagen settles.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How soon after surgery can I start scar treatment?",
      answer:
        "We usually wait until stitches are removed and basic healing is stable, then coordinate with your surgeon. Some early measures start within weeks; stronger treatments are delayed until skin is ready.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you prevent a fresh scar from becoming keloid?",
      answer:
        "If you have keloid history, early silicone, gentle pressure and, in some cases, preventive injections may reduce risk. We cannot guarantee, but careful monitoring improves chances of a calmer scar.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my C-section scar disappear completely?",
      answer:
        "No. Our aim is to help it become flatter, smoother and closer to your skin tone, and more comfortable with waistbands, not to remove every trace of the surgery or childbirth.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is laser safe over old surgical areas?",
      answer:
        "When healing is complete and there are no active issues, yes, with appropriate settings. We avoid aggressive parameters and always consider depth of surgery and underlying structures before planning.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need lifelong scar creams after treatment?",
      answer:
        "Not usually. Silicone or prescription creams are used more actively during the remodelling phase, then tapered as your scar stabilises and both of us are happy with the outcome.",
    },
