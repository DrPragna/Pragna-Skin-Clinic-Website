    intro:
      "Glow & Radiance Facials are doctor-designed, medical-grade facials that hydrate, smooth and brighten without harsh scrubbing. They suit busy weeks when you want visible freshness, plus long-term support for texture and barrier health.",

  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Often monthly or bimonthly",
    duration: "Typically 45–60 minutes",
    downtime: "Usually no true downtime",
    painLevel: "Comfortable, mild sensations",

  overview:
    "These facials may combine cleansing, mild exfoliation, hydrafacials, brightening serums and masks chosen by your dermatologist. They are ideal between stronger treatments or as monthly maintenance for people who prefer minimal downtime.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your skin often looks tired or dull despite sleeping and drinking enough water.",
    "You want something gentler than peels but stronger than basic salon clean-ups.",
    "You are already on pigmentation or acne plans and want safe add-on glow.",
    "Events, shoots or festivals are coming up and you want polished skin.",
    "Your barrier is sensitive, so aggressive scrubs and bleaches never suit you.",

        description:
          "We assess skin type, ongoing treatments and upcoming events, then choose a facial protocol. This decides how much exfoliation, hydration and brightening your skin can handle safely in a single session.",

        title: "Perform curated facial steps",
        description:
          "The session may include cleansing, exfoliation, hydrafacials, gentle extractions when required, masks and serums. Everything is performed with clinic hygiene and controlled products, not random mixing of strong actives.",

        title: "Maintain glow between visits",
        description:
          "You leave with softer, fresher-looking skin and simple aftercare instructions. Regular sessions can support ongoing acne, pigmentation or ageing plans by keeping texture smooth and barrier comfortable between stronger procedures.",

    timeline:
      "Skin usually looks fresher immediately, with best glow appearing over a few days as hydration settles. Monthly or periodic sessions keep results topped up without feeling high-maintenance.",
    recovery:
      "These facials rarely need downtime. Mild pinkness or sensitivity may appear briefly, especially if you already use actives, but settles quickly with moisturiser and sun protection.",

    {
      question: "How are Glow facials different from salon facials?",
      answer:
        "Clinic facials use medical-grade solutions and dermatologist planning, not generic bleach or scrub menus. They are built around your skin condition and treatments, so they support long-term goals as well as immediate glow.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do a Glow facial while on acne treatment?",
      answer:
        "Often yes, especially once severe inflammation is settled. We avoid aggressive extractions or heavy oils, choosing hydrating, calming steps that complement your acne medicines rather than clashing with them.",
    },
    {
      question: "How frequently should I take Glow facials?",
      answer:
        "Many people like monthly or six-weekly sessions. We may suggest different spacing based on your ongoing acne, pigmentation or ageing plan and how your schedule, budget and skin tolerance look.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Glow facials replace my skincare routine?",
      answer:
        "No. They are boosters, not substitutes. Consistent home care with the right cleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen still does most of the daily work, while facials give periodic upgrades.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there an ideal time to schedule Glow facials?",
      answer:
        "We often time them one to two weeks before important events so skin has space to settle. For general maintenance, many patients pick a fixed monthly or festival-linked rhythm.",
    },
