    intro:
      "Hair Fall & Thinning Treatment is a comprehensive plan that investigates causes, stabilises shedding and protects existing strands. It combines medical evaluation, topical and oral therapies and supportive scalp treatments to preserve density where roots are still responsive.",

    sessions: "3–6 months structured care",
    duration: "Visits around 20–40 minutes",
    downtime: "No procedural downtime typically",

  overview:
    "We first identify whether your hair loss is patterned, hormonal, nutritional, illness-linked or stress related. Treatment then uses lifestyle advice, topical solutions, tablets when needed and, if helpful, in-clinic procedures like PRP, mesotherapy or low-level light therapy.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You notice widening partition, lighter ponytail or scalp showing clearly in photographs.",
    "Hair fall continues beyond three months after COVID, illness, exam stress or childbirth.",
    "You suspect PCOS or thyroid issues and see more hair on floor daily.",
    "Family members lost hair early and you want to act before thinning advances.",
    "You have tried oils, home remedies and random supplements without clear structure or results.",

        title: "Detailed hair assessment",
        description:
          "We take a detailed history, examine scalp and hair shafts, review photos, ask about diet, stress, periods, pregnancies and illnesses, and may order blood tests to evaluate iron, vitamin levels and hormones before finalising a diagnosis.",
      },

        phase: "during",
        title: "Start anchor treatments",
        description:
          "We begin anchors such as topical solutions, tablets if indicated, targeted shampoos and sometimes supportive procedures. Protocols are paced so you can follow them alongside work, travel, festivals and family routines without feeling overwhelmed or confused.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Track response and refine",
        description:
          "Follow-ups monitor shedding, side-effects and emotional impact. We adjust medicines, add or pause procedures and shift later into maintenance so results feel sustainable rather than like a crash course you cannot realistically continue.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most people see reduced hair fall by six to twelve weeks, with density changes taking longer. Improvement speed depends on cause, adherence, procedures chosen and how early we start before roots are permanently lost.",
    recovery:
      "There is usually no downtime beyond adjusting to medicines or occasional in-clinic procedures. Minor shedding shifts and temporary scalp dryness can occur initially; we guide you through these phases clearly.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is all hair fall abnormal and dangerous?",
      answer:
        "Some daily shedding is normal; we worry when volume, pattern or duration change. Sudden clumps, widening partition, visible scalp or hair loss after illness, childbirth or crash dieting deserve evaluation rather than only switching shampoos or oils.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can lost hair grow back completely?",
      answer:
        "If follicles are still alive, regrowth or thickening is often possible. When roots are scarred or miniaturised for too long, focus shifts to preserving remaining hair and improving coverage rather than chasing full childhood density again.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need blood tests for hair fall?",
      answer:
        "Often yes. Tests for iron, vitamin D, B12, thyroid and sometimes hormones help us understand hidden contributors. Not everyone needs every test, but targeted investigations make treatments more precise and reduce random supplement trials.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will hair oils alone solve my thinning?",
      answer:
        "Oils can help with massage and dryness but rarely fix true hair loss alone. Underlying causes like hormones, nutrition or illness usually need structured medical care; we include or exclude oils depending on your specific scalp needs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is hair transplant the only permanent option?",
      answer:
        "No. Transplant moves existing follicles but does not stop future loss around them. Many patients benefit first from medical and procedural treatments; transplant, if needed, is best considered once underlying loss is better controlled.",
    },
