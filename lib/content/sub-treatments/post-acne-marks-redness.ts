    intro:
      "After pimples flatten, dark spots and pink marks can stay for months. Post-Acne Marks & Redness treatment gently brightens these traces while keeping your skin barrier calm and your routine practical.",

    sessions: "Usually 3–5 treatment sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 20–40 minutes",

  overview:
    "We pair sunscreen and prescription creams with gentle chemical peels, hydrafacials and sometimes laser toning to fade post-inflammatory colour. Strength is increased slowly, avoiding harsh 'instant fairness' approaches that often irritate and deepen pigmentation on sensitive skin.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Every healed pimple leaves a dark circle that stays long after the bump.",
    "You notice pink halos around old acne spots that cameras highlight easily.",
    "Fairness or spot creams from shops caused stinging, peeling or more darkness.",
    "You want brighter, even tone without aggressive bleaching or obvious downtime.",
    "You can commit to sunscreen daily and scheduled clinic visits for few months.",

        title: "Identify marks and causes",
        description:
          "We separate dark spots from redness and new acne, review products, sun exposure and habits like picking. This guides how strong your creams and peels should be and how slowly we should introduce them.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Layer creams, peels, lasers",
        description:
          "Treatment usually combines brightening creams, daily sunscreen and spaced sessions of gentle peels, hydrafacials or Q-switch laser toning. We tune strength to your tolerance, especially around mouth, nose and sensitive cheek areas.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Maintain gains, prevent relapses",
        description:
          "As spots fade, we simplify routine to a few non-irritating products and strict sun protection. We help you plan around weddings, festivals and trips so peels and actives do not clash with big events.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "Many people notice softer, less sharp spots within four to six weeks. Deeper, older marks usually take two to three months or more, especially if your skin marks easily after every new breakout.",
    recovery:
      "Most sessions cause only short redness or mild dryness for a few days. With moisturiser and sunscreen, you can usually continue office, college and social plans without drawing extra attention.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Are these post-acne marks actually scars?",
      answer:
        "No. Marks involve colour change without deep texture loss, whereas scars are dents or raised areas. Colour usually responds to creams, peels and lasers, while scars need additional procedures for collagen remodelling.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my skin peel a lot after peels?",
      answer:
        "For post-acne marks we usually choose lighter or medium-strength peels, causing fine flaking rather than dramatic sheets. We explain expected peeling beforehand so you can schedule around meetings or functions comfortably.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can home remedies safely remove these dark spots?",
      answer:
        "DIY fixes like lemon, toothpaste or undiluted oils often irritate skin and worsen pigmentation, especially on Indian tones. Evidence-based brighteners and supervised procedures usually give safer, more predictable improvement.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will these treatments make me overall fairer?",
      answer:
        "No. The aim is to reduce extra pigmentation and redness, not change your natural shade. When marks fade, skin often appears brighter and more even, but fairness is never the target.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we treat marks while acne is still active?",
      answer:
        "We usually focus on calming new acne first, then add stronger mark treatments. Gentle brighteners and sunscreen can start earlier, but investing heavily in procedures while breakouts continue often leads to fresh spots again.",
    },
