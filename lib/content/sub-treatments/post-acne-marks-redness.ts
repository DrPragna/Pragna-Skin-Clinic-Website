  overview: "Post-acne marks can be brown, purple, or red, and often show up more on Indian skin. We address them using a mix of prescription creams, medical-grade sunscreens, chemical peels, and light or laser-based treatments where needed. The aim is to even out skin tone gradually without over-stripping your skin.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Pigmentation Assessment & Planning",
        description: "We examine your marks to distinguish between brown pigmentation and red or pink post-acne redness. Your dermatologist reviews your current products and may advise stopping harsh scrubs or actives. Pre-treatment prep usually includes consistent sunscreen and gentle skincare for a few days."
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Targeted Peels & Brightening Protocols",
        description: "Depending on your skin type and sensitivity, we may perform mild to moderate chemical peels, toning-based procedures, or brightening facials designed for post-acne marks. You may feel a tingling or warm sensation that is closely monitored for comfort during the 30-45 minute session."
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Protection, Hydration & Maintenance",
        description: "After treatment, your skin may look slightly pink or feel tight for a short period. We guide you on gentle cleansers, moisturisers, and strict sun protection to support fading of marks. Mild flaking can occur for a few days, and we schedule follow-ups to space sessions safely."

  results: {
    timeline: "Most patients notice a subtle glow and slightly fresher look within a couple of sessions, with visible lightening of marks over 3-6 sessions when combined with home care. Older, deeper marks may take longer, and we always set realistic expectations upfront.",
    recovery: "Recovery is usually smooth with day-to-day activities unaffected. Redness, mild sensitivity, or flaking can appear for a short time and is managed with moisturisers and sunscreen."

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will my marks go away completely?",
      answer: "Many recent post-acne marks can fade very well with a combination of treatments and sun protection, but some deeper or long-standing pigmentation may not disappear 100%. Our aim is to make marks far less noticeable and your overall skin tone more even."
    },
    {
      question: "How soon after acne treatment can I treat marks?",
      answer: "We usually start focusing on marks once your active acne is reasonably under control. In mild cases, certain mark-focused treatments can be started earlier, but your dermatologist will time them so as not to irritate already inflamed skin."
    },
    {
      question: "Are chemical peels safe for Indian skin?",
      answer: "When chosen and performed correctly by a dermatologist, chemical peels can be very safe and effective for Indian skin. We select peel strength, type, and contact time carefully and always pair it with strong sun protection and barrier repair."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use home remedies instead?",
      answer: "Many DIY remedies like lemon, toothpaste, or undiluted essential oils can irritate skin and worsen pigmentation. It is safer to use evidence-based treatments and dermatologist-recommended products, especially on already sensitive, post-acne skin."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I need maintenance sessions?",
      answer: "Some patients maintain results with occasional touch-up sessions or continued topical creams, especially if their skin is prone to pigmentation. We personalise maintenance advice based on how your skin responds and your lifestyle."
