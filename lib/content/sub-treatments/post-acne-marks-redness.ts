    intro:
      "Even when acne stops, the reminders stay - brown spots, red patches, uneven tone. Post-acne mark treatment focuses on fading these signs with pigment-targeting peels, laser toning, redness-focused lasers and topical care so your skin tone looks quieter and more even over time.",

  overview:
    "Brown marks are usually post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, while red marks often indicate healing vessels. We use different tools for each: salicylic, glycolic, lactic or azelaic peels and Q-switched laser toning for brown spots, and vascular lasers or IPL-like technologies and soothing routines for redness.",

        description:
          "We separate true scars from marks, and brown marks from red ones. Your natural skin tone, sensitivity, past reactions and current acne status are checked. A gentle home routine with sunscreen, pigment-regulating and barrier-repair ingredients is started or optimised before heavier in-clinic work.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Targeting brown and red separately",
        description:
          "For brown spots, we use mild to moderate peels and low-fluence Q-switched toning sessions. For redness, we focus on calming and vascular-targeted devices when needed, along with anti-inflammatory topicals. Expect short episodes of tingling, warmth and temporary pinkness, followed by cooling and soothing products.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Gentle fading, not harsh stripping",
        description:
          "We avoid aggressive, repeated strong peels that could create new marks. Instead, we build in steady but skin-friendly cycles. You'll get clear instructions on moisturiser and sun protection, what products to pause, and why not scratching, scrubbing or doing random facials in between matters.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "Depending on your skin and how old the marks are, many people notice a fresher, less blotchy look after 2-3 sessions. Brown spots usually lighten over several weeks, while redness often calms faster once the right soothing and vascular-focused measures are in place.",
    recovery:
      "Most sessions have minimal downtime - mild redness, flaking or a slightly tanned look to marks for a couple of days before they fade. You can generally continue work or college with sunscreen and light, non-comedogenic makeup if desired.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Are these marks the same as scars?",
      answer:
        "No. Marks are about colour - brown or red patches - while scars change the texture of the skin. Marks often respond well to peels, lasers and creams, whereas scars need deeper treatments like subcision, MNRF or fractional lasers. Many people have both, and we plan for each separately.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I just use vitamin C or niacinamide at home instead?",
      answer:
        "Good homecare is important and we do use these ingredients, but for stubborn marks, in-clinic treatments speed up fading and help maintain results. We'll help you pair the right clinic plan with a realistic, affordable home routine.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why are my marks darker than my original skin tone?",
      answer:
        "After inflammation, pigment cells in Indian skin often overreact and release extra melanin in that spot. Without sun protection or proper treatment, this extra pigment can linger for months, making marks appear darker than the surrounding skin.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will stronger peels remove marks faster?",
      answer:
        "Not always - and on Indian skin, very strong or frequent peels can actually cause more pigmentation. We prefer controlled, repeated mild-to-moderate treatments that gently lift pigment without injuring the skin barrier.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I treat marks while I still get a few pimples?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but active acne also needs attention so we're not constantly chasing new marks. Often we combine acne control with mark-fading in the same phase, adjusting intensity depending on how calm or active your skin is.",
    },
