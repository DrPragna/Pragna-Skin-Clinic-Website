        description:
          "We examine lesions, check for infections, folliculitis, fungal elements and friction triggers, then review lifestyle, gym habits and clothing so we treat the correct problem and not just repeatedly change creams.",

        title: "Control active acne first",
        description:
          "We start medicated washes, appropriate tablets when indicated and peels, then, once breakouts are under better control, introduce lasers, microneedling or additional peels to work on scars, marks and texture safely.",

        title: "Maintain clear, calmer skin",
        description:

    timeline:
      "Active breakouts usually calm over weeks with proper medicines and peels, while marks and scars need repeated sessions and good sun protection for gradual improvement over several months.",

    {
      question: "Why does my back still break out when my face improved?",
      answer:
        "Back skin faces different triggers—sweat, friction, heavy backpacks and tight clothing. Products that helped your face may not suit your back; we tailor washes, medicines and procedures specifically for body skin.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will body peels make my skin very sensitive?",
      answer:
        "Peels can cause short-term dryness, flaking and sensitivity, but with correct strengths, intervals and moisturiser use, most people tolerate them well and see improved clarity over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I continue gym and sports during treatment?",
      answer:
        "Usually yes, with some adjustments. We recommend breathable fabrics, quick showers after sweating, avoiding harsh scrubs and choosing backpacks or gear that reduce friction on already inflamed areas.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are body acne scars treatable like facial scars?",
      answer:
        "Body scars often need stronger settings and more patience, as skin is thicker and oilier. We still see meaningful improvement in many people using peels, lasers and microneedling RF plus proper aftercare.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will treatment lighten my natural body colour?",
      answer:
        "The focus is on evening out patchiness, marks and redness, not changing your inherent tone. Your natural colour remains; the aim is calmer, more uniform-looking skin where acne once flared.",
    },
