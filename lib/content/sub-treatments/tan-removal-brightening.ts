    intro:
      "Tan Removal & Brightening focuses on reversing sun-made dullness, especially after holidays, outdoor work or sports. We combine exfoliating peels, hydrafacials and smart home care to restore a more even, rested-looking complexion.",

  overview:
    "We address tan and surface roughness with gentle to medium-strength peels, hydrafacials and tailored skincare. The focus is on realistic brightening and smoother texture, not drastic overnight change or stripping away your natural colour.",

    "After a trip or summer, your face and neck are several shades apart.",
    "Outdoor work, biking or sports keep giving you stubborn tan lines and dullness.",
    "Regular parlour facials give temporary glow, but your colour quickly looks tired again.",
    "You want to look fresher on camera without filters or heavy base makeup.",

        title: "Understand lifestyle and tan",
        description:
          "We ask about work, commute, sports, sunscreen use and recent holidays, then examine tan pattern and texture. This distinguishes uniform tan from patchy pigmentation and decides how strong your first peel or facial should be.",

        title: "Perform brightening sessions",
        description:
          "Sessions may involve cleansing, mild exfoliation, tailored peels, hydrafacials and soothing masks. We keep you informed about sensations and expected flaking so you feel prepared, not surprised, when skin starts renewing.",

        description:
          "We send you home with simple, non-stripping care and clear sun advice. Occasional top-up sessions are planned around events so you look fresh for functions, photos or travel without last-minute panic.",

    timeline:
      "Most people notice softer tan lines and better glow after one or two sessions, with more even tone building over several weeks as sunscreen and home care stay consistent.",
    recovery:
      "Mild redness or flaking can appear for a few days, especially after peels. With moisturiser and sun protection, daily work and social activities rarely need to pause.",

    {
      question: "Can tan removal treatments change my natural colour?",
      answer:
        "No. These treatments aim to remove excess tan and dullness, not alter your basic shade. When fresh layers show and damage fades, you look brighter and more rested, not unnaturally light.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon after a vacation can I start?",
      answer:
        "We usually like a short gap so skin settles from sunburn or irritation. Then we begin with gentle options, increasing strength only if your skin handles early sessions comfortably.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will results last if I go back in the sun?",
      answer:
        "Realistically, tan will return with strong sun. Good sunscreen, hats, shade and occasional maintenance sessions help preserve brightness and stop each new tan from settling as deeply as before.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are these similar to parlour facials?",
      answer:
        "No. Medical facials and peels use clinic-grade solutions, sterile techniques and dermatologist supervision. They focus on skin health and pigment, not only massage, fragrance or short-lived surface glow.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do tan treatments before my wedding?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but planning matters. We prefer starting a few months early to test strengths, then scheduling mild brightening sessions closer to the functions so skin looks fresh, not freshly peeled.",
    },
