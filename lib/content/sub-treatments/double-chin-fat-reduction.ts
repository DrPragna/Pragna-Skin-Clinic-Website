    intro:
      "Double Chin Fat Reduction uses injectable or device-based treatments to target fat under the chin, helping restore a cleaner neck angle and jawline profile without surgical liposuction.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Plan of 2–6 sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 20–40 minutes",
    downtime: "Swelling, bruises, tightness days",
    painLevel: "Stinging, heat, tolerable overall",
  },
  overview:
    "Depending on suitability, we use fat-dissolving injections, tightening devices or both to reduce under-chin fullness, especially where genetics, posture or weight have softened an otherwise defined jawline.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your side-profile photos show fullness under chin despite fair fitness.",
    "Double chin appears even when you are not significantly overweight.",
    "Selfies or video calls highlight neck fold more than jawline.",
    "You are not ready for surgical liposuction or facelifts.",
    "You can follow strict aftercare around swelling and posture.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Assess fullness and skin quality",
        description:
          "We examine fat depth, skin laxity, bite pattern, neck length and overall face structure, then decide whether injections, devices or a combination are appropriate and safely achievable for your health profile.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform injectable or device treatment",
        description:
          "After numbing, we either inject small amounts of fat-dissolving solution in a marked grid or run chosen devices under the chin, continuously checking comfort and symmetry during the session.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Support healing, habits and posture",
        description:
          "We advise on sleeping, compression if needed, salt intake, exercise and screen posture so swelling settles well and new contour is supported instead of being undone by everyday habits.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Initial swelling can hide change; contour usually becomes clearer over weeks to months as fat reduces and tissues settle.",
    recovery:
      "Swelling, numbness, bruises or tightness are common; cold compresses, medicines and posture care generally keep discomfort manageable.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Can double chin fat return after treatment?",
      answer:
        "Remaining fat cells can still enlarge with weight gain. We therefore emphasise long-term lifestyle, posture and realistic maintenance rather than assuming treated areas will stay unchanged regardless of future habits.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is double chin treatment only for younger people?",
      answer:
        "No. Suitability depends on skin quality, medical history and goals, not age alone. We explain when procedures help and when surgery or simple acceptance might be kinder, more realistic options.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will injections make my jawline perfectly sharp?",
      answer:
        "Treatments improve under-chin bulk; bone structure, teeth, weight and genetics still matter. We aim for meaningful refinement, not a completely altered, filtered-jawline look that may not suit your natural face.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine this with jawline contouring?",
      answer:
        "Yes, often double chin reduction and jawline contouring complement each other. We stage them sensibly so swelling, budgets and recovery are balanced while keeping your overall lower-face appearance harmonious and believable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there any scarring with fat-reduction injections?",
      answer:
        "We use fine needles and mapped injection points. Tiny marks or bruises usually fade quickly; persistent scars are uncommon when aftercare instructions about sun, picking and pressure are followed carefully.",
    },
