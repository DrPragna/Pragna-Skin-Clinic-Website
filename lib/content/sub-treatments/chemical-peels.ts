    intro:
      "Chemical Peels use measured acids to dissolve dead cells, unclog pores and brighten pigmentation. At PSC, peels are chosen by a dermatologist for your skin type and concerns, not as a one-strength-fits-all salon service.",

    sessions: "Typically 3–6 peel sessions",
    duration: "Around 20–30 minutes each",

  overview:
    "We use peels like glycolic, salicylic, mandelic, lactic or combination formulas to treat acne, pigmentation and texture. Depth and intervals are adjusted carefully so you see results without unsafe burning, frosting or long, patchy downtime.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You have acne, marks or dullness that never fully respond to only creams.",
    "Salon facials feel too mild, but lasers feel like too big a step.",
    "You want medical peels where strength, layers and gaps are individually decided.",
    "You can follow sun protection and basic aftercare instructions reliably after each session.",
    "You are okay with brief flaking if deeper results follow later.",

        description:
          "We check your diagnosis, medicines, skin sensitivity and event calendar, then choose peel type and strength. This planning reduces surprises and helps you know exactly what temporary redness or flaking to expect.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Apply peel in layers",
        description:
          "Skin is cleansed, prepped and peel solution applied in controlled layers. You may feel stinging or heat for a few minutes until neutralisation, after which soothing creams and sunscreen are applied.",

        title: "Manage peeling phase safely",
        description:
          "We explain what to expect over the next days, including dryness, possible micro-flaking and colour changes. Clear do-and-don't lists keep results on track and minimise chances of patchy darkening or scarring.",

    timeline:
      "Many people notice clearer pores and fresher tone within one to two sessions. Deeper pigmentation or scars usually need multiple peels plus other treatments over several months for meaningful, stable improvement.",
    recovery:
      "Redness and tightness are common for a day; flaking can last several days. With moisturiser and sunscreen, most patients work and socialise comfortably through the peeling phase.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Are chemical peels safe for darker skin tones?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when chosen and timed correctly. We prefer gentler acids, fewer layers and longer gaps initially, increasing only after we see how your skin heals and whether pigmentation behaves predictably.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my skin peel in visible sheets after every session?",
      answer:
        "Not always. Many light or medium peels cause only fine flaking or roughness. We tell you beforehand when a stronger, more visibly peeling session is planned so you can schedule events accordingly.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do peels in summer or only winter?",
      answer:
        "Peels are possible year-round if sunscreen and shade are taken seriously. In harsh summers we may choose milder formulas, longer gaps and stricter sun rules to keep your skin safe.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do peels thin my skin permanently over time?",
      answer:
        "Properly spaced, supervised peels usually improve skin quality rather than thinning it. Problems arise with unsupervised, frequent or overly strong peels, especially combined with harsh scrubs or bleaching creams.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I wear makeup during the peeling phase?",
      answer:
        "Light, non-comedogenic makeup is often fine once redness settles, but heavy foundation on actively peeling skin can worsen irritation. We guide you per peel strength and your comfort after each session.",
    },
