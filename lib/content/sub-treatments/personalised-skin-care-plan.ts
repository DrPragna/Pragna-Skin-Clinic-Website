      question: "Can you work with products I already own?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We prefer starting from what you have. Often we only remove extras, rearrange order and fill a few true gaps rather than asking you to replace everything at once.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this just a sales pitch for certain brands?",
      answer:
        "No. We focus on ingredient types and textures, then suggest options across budgets. You can choose from brands you trust, as long as formulations align with the plan we have created.",

      question: "How often should I review my Skin-Care Plan?",
      answer:
        "Most people like a review every three to six months or after big changes like new medicines, pregnancy, climate shifts or major procedures that may require adjusting actives.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my routine be very long and complicated?",
      answer:
        "We aim for realistic routines: usually three to five steps morning and night. If you enjoy more layers, we can add optional extras, but the core plan stays simple and sustainable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help phase in actives like retinoids safely?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We decide starting strength, frequency and companions like moisturiser and sunscreen, then create a ramp-up schedule so your skin adjusts with minimal purging or irritation.",
