    intro:
      "If your cheeks feel heavier, jawline less defined and neck skin looser than before, non-surgical tightening can gently 'shrink-wrap' the deeper support layers. Using HIFU, radiofrequency and MNRF, we stimulate collagen so the lower face and neck look firmer over the next few months.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "1-3 sessions, yearly touch-ups",
    duration: "45-75 mins (area dependent)",
    downtime: "Mild redness; usually 0-2 days",
    painLevel: "Deep warmth & tingling",
  },
  overview:
    "HIFU (high intensity focused ultrasound) targets deeper layers close to the SMAS plane, while radiofrequency and MNRF work in the dermis. Together they trigger new collagen and elastin, tightening skin on the cheeks, jawline and neck without cuts, stitches or long recovery.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You notice jowls or a soft jawline when you look at side-profile photos",
    "Your neck skin looks crinkled or loose compared to your face",
    "You're not ready for surgery but want some lift and firmness",
    "You're okay waiting a few months for results if it means no scars",
    "You prefer treatments that can be spaced out rather than monthly visits",

        title: "Assessing laxity & planning depth",
        description:
          "We examine your face and neck in upright position, looking at cheek descent, jowls, double chin and neck bands. Based on skin thickness and degree of laxity, we decide whether to rely more on HIFU, radiofrequency, MNRF or a staged combination. Photos are taken so we can track progress objectively over months.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Delivering focused energy",
        description:
          "With HIFU, you'll feel short bursts of deep, hot pinpoints as the ultrasound focuses under the skin. Radiofrequency and MNRF feel like a series of warm pricks or a heated stamping sensation. A cooling gel, numbing cream or pain-control plan is used in sensitive areas. Sessions can take 45-75 minutes depending on zones treated.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Letting collagen do the work",
        description:
          "The skin may look slightly pink and feel tight or tender for a day or two. Most people resume normal work the same or next day. Over the next 8-12 weeks, new collagen fibres form and contract, leading to a gradually firmer contour. We review you periodically and plan if any second or third session is needed.",

    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "A mild 'tight' feeling is common immediately, but the real lift develops slowly as collagen remodels, usually from week 4 onwards. Results typically continue to improve for up to 3-6 months after a HIFU or RF course and can be maintained with yearly top-up sessions.",
    recovery:
      "Apart from short-lived redness or tenderness, there's usually little to show on the surface. Occasional mild swelling or temporary numb patches can happen and generally settle within days.",

    {
      question: "Will skin tightening replace a surgical facelift?",
      answer:
        "Non-surgical tightening is best for mild-to-moderate laxity. It won't replicate the effect of a surgical facelift in very advanced sagging, but it can delay or reduce the need for surgery and keep your tissues in better shape in the meantime.",
    },
    {
      question: "How soon can I do this before a big event?",
      answer:
        "Because results build slowly, it's ideal to plan your main tightening session at least 2-3 months before an important event. That gives your collagen time to respond and any transient redness or tenderness to settle fully.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does HIFU or RF thin the face too much?",
      answer:
        "Used correctly, the goal is to tighten supporting structures without hollowing you out. We avoid over-treating already thin areas and are especially careful in patients with very low body fat so we don't create a gaunt look.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine tightening with fillers or Botox?",
      answer:
        "Yes, and combinations are common. Tightening gives structural support, while fillers restore lost volume and Botox relaxes overactive muscles. We usually do energy-based tightening first and then layer injectables after initial healing for best control over the final shape.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is one session enough for life?",
      answer:
        "Your skin will keep ageing. A well-done tightening session can give results for a year or more, but gravity, lifestyle and genetics continue their work. Many people repeat a light session every 12-18 months to maintain firmness.",
