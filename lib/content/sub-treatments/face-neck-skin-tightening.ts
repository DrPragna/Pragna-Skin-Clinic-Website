    tagline: "Lift laxity without surgery",
    intro:
      "This treatment uses HIFU and radiofrequency tightening to target mild to moderate sagging of cheeks, jawline and neck. It gently stimulates collagen, giving a firmer outline without cuts, stitches or time in an operating theatre.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Often 1–3 sessions planned",
    duration: "Each sitting 45–90 minutes",
    downtime: "Warmth, tightness for days",
    painLevel: "Heat, brief sharp zaps",
  },
  overview:
    "Focused ultrasound and radiofrequency deliver energy beneath the skin to tighten collagen and support structures. Suitable candidates see subtle lifting of jawline, nasolabial area and neck over time, especially when combined with skincare and lifestyle changes.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Your lower face looks softer, with jowls forming near the mouth and chin.",
    "Neck skin feels loose or creased, especially in side-profile photos and video calls.",
    "You want tightening but are not ready for threads or surgical lifting yet.",
    "Weight changes or pregnancies have softened your once-sharp jawline and neck angle.",
    "You prefer gradual improvement that colleagues notice as 'healthier', not drama.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Evaluate laxity and suitability",
        description:
          "We check how much skin and deeper tissue have loosened, feel fat pads and muscles, and review medical history. This helps decide whether HIFU, radiofrequency or a combination will be worthwhile or if other options are better.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Deliver focused energy lines",
        description:
          "We mark treatment zones, apply gel and deliver energy in precise lines and depths. You feel heat and zaps, more over bony areas. Settings are adjusted to balance effectiveness with comfort and safety.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Monitor lift over months",
        description:
          "There is usually little immediate change; collagen tightening shows gradually. We review photos at three to six months, decide if a top-up pass is useful and advise on skincare and lifestyle to prolong results.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Tightening is typically most visible between three and six months as collagen remodels. Effects can last a year or more, especially when weight and lifestyle stay stable and sun care remains consistent.",
    recovery:
      "You may feel deep ache or tightness for a few days. Visible redness is usually mild; occasional swelling or tenderness settles with simple measures and rarely interferes with regular routines.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Am I too young for skin tightening?",
      answer:
        "Suitability depends more on laxity, genetics and weight changes than age alone. We are honest if your skin is too firm for meaningful benefit and suggest simpler prevention-focused plans instead.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can tightening replace a surgical facelift?",
      answer:
        "Non-surgical tightening helps early to moderate laxity, not very heavy jowls or large neck folds. We explain realistic lift expectations and sometimes recommend surgical opinions for advanced cases.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many tightening sessions will I need?",
      answer:
        "Many patients do a single comprehensive session and review at six months. Others with more laxity may benefit from another pass or combining with MNRF or fillers for better support.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is HIFU safe for my skin tone?",
      answer:
        "HIFU targets deeper tissue, away from pigment cells, so it suits many skin tones. We still choose parameters carefully, avoid over-treatment and provide clear aftercare instructions to minimise unnecessary risk.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I work the next day after treatment?",
      answer:
        "Most people return to work the same or next day. You might feel deep ache on chewing or touching treated areas, but this usually settles without stopping regular office routines.",
    },
  ],
