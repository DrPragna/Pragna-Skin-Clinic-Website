    intro:
      "That small strip of hair on the upper lip or those few stubborn strands on the chin can demand more attention than the rest of your face. This focused laser treatment targets just these areas so you don't have to schedule your calendar around threading appointments.",

  overview:
    "We concentrate laser energy on the upper lip line and chin area, using parameters suited to the thin skin here. Because the treatment area is small, sessions are quick but need to be spaced correctly to catch hair in its active phase.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You keep checking the mirror for upper lip growth before stepping out",
    "Threading leaves tiny cuts or whiteheads around the mouth",
    "Chin hair grows as thick, isolated strands that come back quickly",
    "You see shadow around the mouth even after removing hair",

        description:
          "We outline exactly where you want hair reduced and where you'd like to keep natural fuzz. You may be asked to shave the area lightly or let us trim it in-clinic. Lip balm is applied to protect the vermilion border during treatment.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Short, Intense Burst Session",
        description:
          "A series of quick pulses are delivered along the upper lip and chin. The sensation is like multiple small rubber band snaps, but each pulse lasts a fraction of a second. The whole process often finishes within 10-15 minutes.",

        title: "Cool Compress & Day-Of Care",
        description:
          "We may apply a cool pack or soothing gel. Mild swelling or redness can appear like a thin moustache outline for a short while and then fades. Avoid very hot drinks close to the skin and heavy lip products till the next day.",

    timeline:
      "By the third or fourth session, many people notice slower regrowth and softer hair that is less visible between visits. Completing the course usually results in a dramatic drop in how often you think about upper lip or chin hair.",
    recovery:
      "You can talk, eat, and work as usual. Visible redness typically settles within a couple of hours; most people feel completely normal by the end of the day.",

    {
      question: "Will my upper lip look darker after laser?",
      answer:
        "Temporary pinkness is expected right after the session, but this fades. Long term, many people feel the area looks clearer because there's less thick stubble casting a shadow.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get laser done during my lunch break?",
      answer:
        "Yes, the actual treatment is very quick. If your workplace is okay with mild redness for a couple of hours, you can comfortably return to work after your session.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to stop using lipsticks or lip balms?",
      answer:
        "We recommend keeping heavy, fragranced lip products away from the treated skin for a day. You can still hydrate the lips themselves with simple, non-irritating balms.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will hair grow back thicker if I stop midway?",
      answer:
        "No. If you stop treatment early, the hair that remains continues its usual pattern. It does not suddenly become thicker because of laser.",
    },
