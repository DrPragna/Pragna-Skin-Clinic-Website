    intro:
      "Upper Lip & Chin Hair Reduction focuses on the most frequently threaded areas, helping reduce coarse growth, shadow and repeated irritation that often lead to darkness or tiny bumps around the mouth.",

    sessions: "Commonly 6–8 sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 10–20 minutes",

  overview:
    "Precise diode laser passes target upper lip and chin roots, with special care near lip line and contours. Over time, hair becomes sparser and finer, so regrowth is less noticeable and easier to manage.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Upper lip hair makes you feel conscious in close-up photos.",
    "Chin hair grows back as visible stubble within days of threading.",
    "Repeated upper lip waxing has darkened skin or caused small bumps.",
    "You often need last-minute parlour visits before events or meetings.",
    "PCOS has increased thick, stubborn chin or jawline strands.",

        title: "Check density and pattern",
        description:
          "We examine how closely packed hairs are, look for ingrowns or folliculitis, ask about hormones and previous creams, then decide starting energies and session spacing that your skin can safely handle.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform precise local passes",
        description:
          "Upper lip and chin are shaved, cooled gel applied and short laser passes performed with eye protection. We avoid overlapping excessively on the lip border while ensuring enough coverage for effective targeting.",
      },

        phase: "after",
        title: "Soothe and protect mouth area",
        description:
          "We apply soothing cream, share sunscreen and lip-care advice and ask you to avoid hot waxing, scrubs and strong actives around the mouth in the immediate days after each session.",

    timeline:
      "You may notice slower regrowth and less shadow within a few sessions. Meaningful reduction in coarse strands usually appears by the later part of your treatment course.",
    recovery:
      "Mild redness, tingling or sensitivity around the mouth can last a few hours. Cool compresses, moisturiser and gentle cleansing normally settle these quickly.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is upper lip laser more painful than threading?",
      answer:
        "Most people find laser discomfort different and often easier than threading. Cooling, numbing cream when needed and short treatment time help keep sensations tolerable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I still need to remove some hair later?",
      answer:
        "Possibly. Fine or light strands may persist even after good reduction. Many patients find occasional trimming or rare threading visits enough instead of frequent parlour sessions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do this if I have dark lips?",
      answer:
        "We focus energy on hair-bearing skin and adjust parameters for your tone. We also discuss proper lip care, sunscreen and product choices to prevent additional darkening from irritation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How should I shave upper lip and chin before sessions?",
      answer:
        "We show safe techniques or arrange in-clinic shaving if preferred. The goal is a clean surface without cuts, so the laser energy reaches the hair roots uniformly and effectively.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will laser affect hair on my head or brows?",
      answer:
        "No. We treat only marked, shaved areas. Protective eyewear and clear field marking ensure head hair and eyebrows are not exposed to laser pulses during treatment.",
    },
