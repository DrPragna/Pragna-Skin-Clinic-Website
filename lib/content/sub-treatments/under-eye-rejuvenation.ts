    tagline: "Brighten tired under-eyes",
    intro:
      "This treatment addresses hollows, dark circles and fine lines around the eyes. We combine skincare, peels, under-eye PRP or skin boosters and carefully placed fillers, when appropriate, to refresh without changing your natural eye shape.",

  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Usually 3–4 treatment visits",
    duration: "Each session 30–45 minutes",
    downtime: "Mild swelling, possible bruises",

  },
  overview:
    "We analyse pigment, vessels, fat pads and bone, then choose a mix of topical lightening, peels, PRP, skin boosters or tear-trough fillers. The plan aims for rested eyes, not unrealistically white under-eyes.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "People ask if you are tired even after full nights of sleep.",
    "Concealer either creases or turns ashy over your dark circles.",
    "You notice hollows or tear troughs making eyes look sunken or sad.",
    "Family history or allergies have deepened under-eye concerns over years.",
    "You want improvement but feel nervous about injections near eyes.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Understand cause mix clearly",
        description:
          "We check skin thickness, pigment, veins, fat pads, bone support and habits like rubbing or screens at night. This helps decide whether skincare, PRP, boosters, fillers or combination will actually address your main concern.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform chosen under-eye procedures",
        description:
          "Depending on plan, we may apply peels, inject PRP or boosters in microdroplets, or place tiny amounts of filler deeply using cannula. Numbing cream and slow technique keep discomfort limited and controlled.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Review symmetry and safety",
        description:
          "We recheck contour, swelling and bruising over days to weeks, give clear red-flag instructions and adjust later sessions. Small staging often works better than aggressive filling in one sitting around the eyes.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Skin-quality changes from PRP and boosters appear over one to three months. Filler effects are immediate but refine as swelling settles, usually looking most natural by two to four weeks.",
    recovery:
      "Temporary swelling, bruises or lumpiness can occur, especially after fillers. We show massage, cold compress and sleeping-position tips, and advise when to seek urgent review, though serious issues are rare.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Are my dark circles only from lack of sleep?",
      answer:
        "Sleep helps, but genetics, allergies, rubbing, eye strain, bone structure and pigment also matter. We explain which components you have so expectations and treatment choices stay grounded in reality.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is under-eye filler very risky or scary?",
      answer:
        "The area is delicate, so we use conservative product amounts, cannulas when suitable and careful technique. Complications are uncommon, and you receive clear guidance on what is normal versus when to call.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can creams alone fix under-eye hollows?",
      answer:
        "Creams improve texture and fine lines but cannot replace missing volume or bone support. For true hollows, injectables like fillers or boosters often give more noticeable, structural change than skincare alone.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does under-eye rejuvenation last?",
      answer:
        "PRP and boosters may need refreshers every six to twelve months. Filler support often lasts a year or more, depending on product, lifestyle and how expressive your eye area tends to be.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do this before a big function?",
      answer:
        "We like a safety window, especially for fillers. Ideally, plan several weeks before major events so any swelling or bruises settle and results look natural in photos and real life.",
    },
