    intro:
      "Hollows, dark circles and fine lines under the eyes can make you look exhausted even when you're not. Under-eye rejuvenation blends dermal fillers, PRP, Profhilo, chemical peels and skin boosters to improve volume, colour and texture in this delicate area with a soft, natural finish.",

  overview:
    "Because dark circles come from multiple factors - pigment, vessels, hollows, thin skin - we rarely use just one tool. Carefully placed tear trough fillers support the under-eye, while PRP, Profhilo, skin boosters and peels work on colour and crepey texture for a more rested look.",

    "Concealer collects in fine lines or still doesn't hide the darkness",

        title: "Understanding your dark circles",
        description:
          "We check for pigment, visible vessels, hollows, allergies and lifestyle factors like sleep and screen time. Photos and tilting your head under different lights help us see where the shadow actually comes from. Based on this, we decide how much to focus on filler, PRP/Profhilo, peels or a combination.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Gentle work in a delicate area",
        description:
          "After numbing, tear trough filler is placed with a blunt cannula or fine needle along the bone to avoid lumps. PRP or Profhilo may be injected as tiny blebs in the under-eye skin, and mild peels may be used on the surrounding area to brighten pigment. Expect a feeling of pressure, brief stinging and watery eyes during the process.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Swelling down, glow up",
        description:
          "Mild puffiness, small bumps and occasionally a bruise are common and usually settle within a few days. Cold compresses and sleeping slightly elevated help. We guide you on when to restart actives like retinol and when it's safe to resume full makeup under the eyes.",

    timeline:
      "Fillers give an immediate lift to hollows, with the result refining over 1-2 weeks as swelling resolves. PRP and Profhilo work more slowly; most people notice better glow and smoother texture after 2-3 sessions, spaced 3-4 weeks apart, with continued improvement over several months.",
    recovery:
      "Plan for 2-5 days of 'aware but not obvious' downtime where you may prefer glasses or light makeup. Most people are comfortable returning to work the next day, but we suggest avoiding big events for a week.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will under-eye fillers make my eyes look puffy?",
      answer:
        "When used conservatively and placed at the correct depth, fillers support the hollow rather than creating a 'pillow'. We avoid overfilling, especially if you have existing under-eye puffiness or fluid retention, and may favour PRP/Profhilo in such cases.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can treatment remove darkness completely?",
      answer:
        "Dark circles usually have multiple causes - pigment, thin skin, vessels, hollows and lifestyle factors. We can significantly improve them, but completely erasing darkness is not always realistic. Sun protection, sleep, diet and allergy control all play a supporting role.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do under-eye fillers last?",
      answer:
        "Most under-eye fillers last 9-12 months, sometimes longer, as this area has less movement than the lips. Skin quality treatments like PRP or Profhilo may need maintenance 1-2 times a year to keep the glow and firmness.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is under-eye treatment safe for all skin tones?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but product choice and peel strength are adjusted carefully for Indian and deeper skin tones to avoid post-inflammatory pigmentation. We choose gentle protocols and build up gradually instead of doing very strong peels in one shot.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I look 'different' after treatment?",
      answer:
        "The intention is that you look like yourself on a good day - more rested, less hollow, with smoother skin. We respect your natural eye shape and focus on softening tiredness, not changing your features.",
    },
