    tagline: "Tan out, light in",
    intro:
      "If your skin looks tanned, patchy and a little lifeless after sun, holidays or daily commutes, Mango Bright is a fruit-enzyme and vitamin-rich facial designed to gently lift dullness and restore a soft, even glow—without harsh bleaches.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "3-4 sessions, then occasional top-ups",
    duration: "45-60 mins",
    downtime: "No downtime; rare mild flaking",
    painLevel: "Mild tingling during active mask",
  },
  overview:
    "This facial typically combines a mango-derived enzyme or mild acid step with brightening serums, massage and a radiance-boosting mask. It is meant for early tan, mild uneven tone and flat-looking skin rather than deep pigmentation issues like melasma.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You tan easily and your face looks a shade darker than your neck",
    "You have returned from a trip and your skin tone feels patchy and dull",
    "You avoid harsh bleach creams but still want visible brightening",
    "You are starting to see early spots and unevenness but not ready for strong peels",
    "You want a \"feel good\" facial that also targets glow and tone",

        title: "Tan and pigment assessment",
        description:
          "We check whether your concern is mostly surface tan and dullness or deeper pigmentation like melasma. If it is the latter, we may guide you to medical pigment treatments instead. You will be asked to use sunscreen diligently and pause any strong home exfoliants for a few days.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Enzyme brighten, then nourish",
        description:
          "After cleansing, a fruit-enzyme or gentle acid step is applied to loosen dead, pigmented cells. You may feel a mild tingling while it works before being neutralised or washed off. This is followed by massage, brightening serums (often with ingredients like vitamin C and botanicals) and a glow mask.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Soft, sun-kissed—not sun-beaten",
        description:
          "Skin usually looks fresher and more even right away with no obvious redness. We finish with moisturiser and sunscreen and explain how to maintain the results with daily SPF and simple home care so you do not undo the brightening.",

    timeline:
      "A single session can give a clearer, more even look, especially for recent tan or mild dullness. A short series of 3-4 facials, combined with daily sun protection and pigment-safe skincare, can gradually soften patchiness and keep your skin looking brighter.",
    recovery:
      "Most patients have no visible downtime. Rarely, slightly dry or flaky areas may appear for a day or two if your skin was already very dry; a bland moisturiser usually handles this well.",

      question: "Is Mango Bright a bleach facial?",
      answer:
        "No. It does not use traditional bleach agents that can irritate or damage the skin barrier. Instead, it relies on gentle exfoliation and brightening ingredients to gradually freshen up tone.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will it cure my melasma or deep pigmentation?",
      answer:
        "Mango Bright is best for tan, mild unevenness and dullness. Deep hormonal pigmentation like melasma usually needs targeted medical treatments such as peels, lasers or prescription creams.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I repeat the Mango Bright facial?",
      answer:
        "For recent tan or dullness, we may suggest a few sessions every 3-4 weeks, then shift to occasional maintenance once your skin tone is more stable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can this be combined with other medifacials?",
      answer:
        "Sometimes, yes. Your dermatologist might pair it with other treatments over different visits depending on your goals, but we avoid stacking too many brightening procedures in a single session.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it okay for sensitive skin?",
      answer:
        "Mildly sensitive skin usually tolerates it well with adjustments. If you have a history of strong reactions to products, we will patch test and may choose a gentler option if needed.",
    },
