  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is it safe to treat acne at a young age?",
      answer: "Yes, treating acne early is often safer than leaving it to worsen and scar. We choose age-appropriate medicines and procedures, explain everything clearly, and monitor closely, especially when oral treatments are used."
    },
    {
      question: "Will acne go away on its own after teenage years?",
      answer: "Acne may reduce as hormones stabilise, but for many people it can persist into their 20s or even 30s. Leaving it untreated can increase the chance of scars and marks. Treating it early helps protect both skin and confidence."
    },
    {
      question: "Do acne medicines affect growth or hormones?",
      answer: "When needed, certain prescription medicines are used under strict dermatologist supervision and for the right duration. We explain possible side effects, do any necessary blood tests, and weigh benefits carefully before starting or continuing a medicine."
    },
    {
      question: "Is acne caused only by junk food?",
      answer: "Diet can play a role, but it is rarely the only cause. Hormones, genetics, skincare, stress, and sleep also matter. We may suggest moderating certain foods but will not ask for extreme or unrealistic diet changes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can school or sports continue as normal?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Most treatments are planned to fit around school, exams, and sports. We guide on sun protection, sweat care, and product use so teens can continue their regular activities with more confidence."
