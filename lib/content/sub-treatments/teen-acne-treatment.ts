  overview:
    "We build simple routines teens can stick to, using gentle creams, occasional peels and clear guidance on hair, helmets, diet and makeup. Parents stay involved in decisions so expectations, safety and follow-ups are understood by everyone.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You or your teenager keep getting new pimples on face, shoulders or back.",
    "There is frequent squeezing or picking of spots during school or screen time.",
    "Steroid or fairness creams were tried from chemists or relatives' suggestions.",

        title: "Listen to teen and parent",
        description:
          "We speak with both teen and parent, review school, sports, periods and existing products, including home remedies. The aim is trust and a realistic start, not a long, complicated routine nobody can follow.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Start gentle, escalate slowly",
        description:
          "We begin with mild creams, spot treatments and sometimes very low-strength peels. Tablets are considered only when clearly needed, with full counselling on safety, blood tests if required and the importance of regular follow-ups.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Review progress and habits",
        description:
          "Follow-ups track new pimples, marks and routine adherence, plus confidence at school or online. We adjust plans before exams, events or trips and keep guidance kind, practical and free from blame.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "With consistent routines, many teens notice calmer skin and fewer fresh lesions within six to eight weeks. Longer-term control usually builds over several months as hormones and habits settle.",
    recovery:
      "Most plans rely on creams and mild peels, so school, tuitions and sports continue normally. We usually schedule procedures before weekends or holidays when brief redness bothers less.",

    {
      question: "Is teenage acne only caused by junk food?",
      answer:
        "Food can play a role, but hormones, genetics, helmets, hair oils, late nights and stress also matter. We suggest realistic changes without shaming and design treatment around each teen's actual lifestyle.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can acne medicines affect growth or puberty?",
      answer:
        "Topical creams do not affect growth. When tablets such as antibiotics or hormonal pills are considered, we check medical history carefully and, if useful, coordinate with paediatrician or gynaecologist for added safety.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will starting treatment make skin dependent forever?",
      answer:
        "No. We aim to control acne, prevent scars and then step down to simpler maintenance. Some teens need brief top-ups during stressful periods, but not lifelong aggressive medicines.",
    },
    {
      question: "How involved should parents be in teen acne care?",
      answer:
        "Parental support helps with appointments, medicines and budget, but we also respect teen privacy. We encourage open conversations so nobody feels blamed and everyone understands the plan and photos.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we clear acne fully before board exams?",
      answer:
        "If we start early, we can often reduce angry breakouts and marks before exams. Acne is medical, not a switch, so we promise steady progress, not magically perfect skin on a fixed date.",
    },
