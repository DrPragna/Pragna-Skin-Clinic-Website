    intro:
      "School, exams, sports, hormones - and on top of it, breakouts that hit photos and confidence. Teen acne treatment is designed to control pimples early, protect against long-term scarring and teach good skincare habits, using age-appropriate medicines and gentle procedures that fit into a busy teen's life.",

  overview:
    "Puberty triggers oil glands into overdrive. Our teen protocols use milder strengths of retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics when needed and acne-safe facials or peels. We work closely with parents and teens to build routines that are effective but realistic, without over-drying or overwhelming the skin.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "Pimples started around puberty and now keep coming on the forehead, cheeks or back",
    "Blackheads and whiteheads are always present, even between big breakouts",
    "There's worry about future scars or bullying because of acne",
    "Random YouTube or Instagram routines have made the skin irritated or worse",
    "Parents want a structured, medically supervised plan instead of trial-and-error",

        title: "Teen-friendly consultation",
        description:
          "We talk to both teen and parent - about skin, lifestyle, sports, diet, exam stress and what's already been tried. We explain what acne is in simple language and set realistic expectations so no one feels blamed. A step-by-step home routine is written down clearly so it's easy to follow.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Gentle but effective treatment",
        description:
          "We use appropriate-strength medicines (topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics or hormonal treatment when indicated) and may add gentle salicylic or azelaic peels, comedone extraction and light-based treatments. We avoid overly harsh peels or protocols that would disrupt school, sports or social life.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Habits to prevent future scars",
        description:
          "Follow-up visits focus on tracking progress, adjusting doses and reinforcing habits - no picking, better makeup and helmet hygiene, smart sunscreen use and how to handle exam-time flare-ups. As acne settles, we can also address any early marks before they become stubborn.",

  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most teens see fewer new pimples and less oiliness in 4-8 weeks if they follow the plan. Bigger changes in scars and marks take longer and may require a second phase of treatment once breakouts are calmer.",
    recovery:
      "Side effects like dryness or mild sensitivity are common but manageable and usually improve as the skin adjusts. We design regimens so school, coaching and activities can continue without major disruption.",

    {
      question: "Is acne in teens just a phase that will go away on its own?",
      answer:
        "Hormonal acne often improves with age, but severe or persistent acne can leave permanent scars and marks if left untreated. Early, sensible treatment can prevent long-term damage even if some mild breakouts happen later.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will acne medicines thin my teen's skin?",
      answer:
        "When used correctly at the right strengths, acne medicines don't permanently thin the skin. Some initial dryness or peeling is expected but can be controlled with moisturisers and dose adjustments. We monitor closely and explain warning signs to watch for.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can diet and junk food cause teen acne?",
      answer:
        "Diet isn't the only reason, but very high sugar, certain dairy patterns and frequent junk food can worsen acne in some teens. We'll point out simple, realistic food tweaks without creating guilt or extreme restrictions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe for teens to do peels or laser treatments?",
      answer:
        "Mild, carefully chosen peels and certain light-based treatments are safe in teens when done by dermatologists. We avoid very aggressive procedures and always prioritise safety and long-term skin health over quick cosmetic results.",
    },
    {
      question: "How involved do parents need to be?",
      answer:
        "Parental support makes a big difference - reminding about medicines, helping with product purchases and encouraging healthy habits. We keep parents informed about the plan and progress while also respecting the teen's privacy and emotions.",
    },
