    intro:
      "Fine hair on the cheeks, darker growth on the jawline, or a faint beard-like shadow can make you reach for filters in every selfie. Facial laser hair reduction targets these areas so skin looks smoother in real life, not just on screen.",

  overview:
    "Using diode and Alexandrite settings tuned to facial skin, we focus on the upper lip, chin, jawline, side-locks, or full lower face depending on your pattern. The aim is to gradually replace thick, coarse hair with minimal, lighter growth that doesn't catch the light or show in close-ups.",

        description:
          "We decide exactly which facial zones to treat and which to leave natural, especially around the hairline and brows. You'll be advised whether to come shaved or if the team will clip hair at the clinic. Active acne or broken skin is noted so we can work around it safely.",

        title: "Precision Facial Laser Session",
        description:
          "After cleansing, protective eyewear is placed. Short laser pulses are delivered in rows along the treatment zones. You'll feel quick hot snaps with a blast of cold air or chilled tip immediately after each pulse. Smaller areas like upper lip are done in minutes; full lower face takes longer.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Redness, Cooling & Makeup Timing",
        description:
          "A soothing gel or cream is applied. Most redness fades within a few hours, but we recommend waiting till the next morning before applying makeup on the treated areas. Gentle face wash and sunscreen are continued; harsh scrubs are avoided for a few days.",

    timeline:
      "Many people notice makeup gliding on more smoothly and less 'shadow' within 2-3 sessions. Over 6-8 sessions, coarse strands reduce significantly, and regrowth tends to be finer, slower, and less obvious on camera.",
    recovery:
      "Apart from short-lived redness or mild swelling, there's usually nothing visible by the next day. You can work, attend classes, or step out as usual with sun protection.",

    {
      question: "Will laser make my facial hair thicker if I stop?",
      answer:
        "No. Laser targets the root to weaken it; it does not stimulate new, thicker hair. If you stop midway, the hair that remains simply follows its natural pattern, usually finer than before.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do laser if I have PCOS or hormonal issues?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but we'll factor hormones into your plan. Laser can still reduce visible hair, though you may need more sessions or occasional maintenance. We may also suggest seeing a gynecologist or endocrinologist for parallel hormonal management.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is facial laser safe around the mouth and nose?",
      answer:
        "We protect your eyes with goggles and avoid going too close to sensitive mucosal surfaces. The upper lip, chin, and jawline can be treated safely with the right shielding and energy levels.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will there be a break-out after the session?",
      answer:
        "Most people do not break out. If your skin is acne-prone, we'll choose soothing gels and non-comedogenic sunscreens and keep a close watch on your first few sessions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I still thread my eyebrows?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We usually do not laser the brows, so you can continue threading or tweezing them as you prefer.",
    },
