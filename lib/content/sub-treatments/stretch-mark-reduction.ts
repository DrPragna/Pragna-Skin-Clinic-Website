    tagline: "Softening lines, not erasing life",
    intro:
      "Stretch Mark Reduction focuses on fading colour and improving texture of marks from growth, weight change or pregnancy, using collagen-remodelling treatments, creams and sun care to make them less noticeable in daily life.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Often 4–8 treatment sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 30–60 minutes",
    downtime: "Redness, dots, mild flaking",
    painLevel: "Heat, pricks, manageable overall",
  },
  overview:
    "We treat stretch marks on tummy, hips, thighs, breasts or arms with fractional lasers, microneedling RF, peels and prescription creams. The goal is realistic softening and blending, not promising that every line will vanish altogether.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You developed stretch marks after puberty, gym growth or weight changes.",
    "Post-pregnancy tummy or hip marks bother you in sarees or fitted outfits.",
    "Marks have faded slightly but still look stark against your skin tone.",
    "You understand we can improve, not completely delete, older stretch marks.",
    "You can commit to repeated sessions and careful sun protection afterwards.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Evaluate marks and safety",
        description:
          "We check how old the marks are, their colour, depth and location, ask about pregnancies, weight swings and keloid history, then decide which devices and strengths are suitable for your skin and lifestyle right now.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Perform collagen-remodelling sessions",
        description:
          "We use fractional lasers, microneedling RF or both across marked areas, sometimes combining peels or PRP. Expect heat, pinpricks and grid-like marks that settle over days as the skin begins deeper repair work.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Guide healing and home care",
        description:
          "We explain moisturising, clothing, bathing and sun-care rules, prescribe creams to support collagen and pigment balancing and schedule sessions at safe intervals so your skin rebuilds steadily between treatments.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Newer, reddish marks often respond faster than old, silvery ones. Most patients see softening and better blending over several months rather than overnight change after a single session.",
    recovery:
      "Redness, roughness, grid marks or mild swelling are common for a few days; gentle moisturiser, loose clothing and sun protection usually keep you comfortable.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Can stretch marks be removed completely and permanently?",
      answer:
        "No treatment can erase them completely. We focus on improving texture and colour so they blend better with surrounding skin and feel less prominent in mirrors, photos and clothing choices.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are early red stretch marks easier to treat?",
      answer:
        "Yes, marks that are still pink or purplish tend to respond better and faster. Older white or silvery marks improve more slowly and usually need more sessions plus ongoing home care.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is stretch mark treatment safe in Indian skin tones?",
      answer:
        "With carefully chosen energies, intervals and aftercare, yes. We move slowly, especially in deeper or darker tones, to avoid new darkening or post-inflammatory marks while trying to improve existing ones.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will weight gain or pregnancy bring marks back?",
      answer:
        "New stretching can create new marks even on treated areas. We emphasise healthy weight management, moisturising and realistic expectations, especially around future pregnancies and lifestyle changes.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can creams alone treat stretch marks?",
      answer:
        "Creams support hydration and collagen but have limited power alone. Devices and peels usually provide deeper change; we still use prescription creams to maintain and enhance procedural results.",
    },
