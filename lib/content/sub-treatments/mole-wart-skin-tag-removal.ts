  overview:
    "We examine each lesion, decide whether simple removal is enough or biopsy is needed, then use methods like cautery, excision, radiofrequency or cryotherapy, chosen according to type, size, site and your scarring tendency.",

        title: "Evaluate and plan precisely",
        description:
          "We assess colour, borders, surface and history, sometimes using dermatoscopy. Suspicious lesions may be biopsied instead of just removed cosmetically, prioritising diagnosis and safety over quick fixes.",

        title: "Remove with chosen technique",
        description:
          "After numbing, we remove growths using cautery, excision or other methods. Techniques are selected to minimise bleeding and scarring while respecting nearby structures like eyelids, lips or nail folds.",

        title: "Guide wound care and follow-up",
        description:

    timeline:
      "Crusts usually fall in one to two weeks; redness and scar maturation continue for several months, slowly blending with surrounding skin.",

      "Temporary redness, scabs or mild discomfort are normal. Picking at crusts or skipping sunscreen can worsen marks, so aftercare matters as much as the procedure.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Are all moles safe to remove cosmetically?",
      answer:
        "No. Some need biopsy or monitoring first. We never shave off or cauterise suspicious moles purely for looks; diagnosis and safety always come first.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will the mole, wart or tag grow back?",
      answer:
        "Some lesions, especially warts, can recur. Technique, immunity and friction all play roles. We discuss recurrence risk honestly and recommend follow-up if regrowth occurs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do mole removal at a salon or spa?",
      answer:
        "We strongly discourage this. Non-medical burning or cutting can cause infection, scarring and missed skin cancers. Medical evaluation and sterile technique are important.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will there be a scar after removal?",
      answer:
        "Any skin break can leave a mark. We choose methods to minimise it and guide scar care, but a completely scarless result cannot be guaranteed, especially on certain body sites.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is local anaesthesia injection very painful?",
      answer:
        "There is brief stinging or pressure, but it quickly numbs the area so the actual removal feels only like movement or mild tugging rather than pain.",
    },
