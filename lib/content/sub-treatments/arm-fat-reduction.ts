    title: "Arm Fat Reduction",
    tagline: "Tone upper arms non-surgically",
    intro:
      "Arm Fat Reduction targets upper arm fullness that makes sleeves feel tight or creates a \"bat wing\" look, using body-contouring devices and simple toning guidance to achieve a neater arm outline.",
  },
  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Plan of 4–8 sessions",
    duration: "Each visit 20–40 minutes",
    downtime: "Soreness, redness, rare bruises",
    painLevel: "Heat, tugging, usually tolerable",
  },
  overview:
    "We treat upper arms with devices that heat or mechanically target fat while encouraging light strength training, so arms look slimmer in sleeveless outfits, blouses and office wear without surgical scars.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You avoid sleeveless or fitted sleeves because of arm shape.",
    "Weight loss reduced tummy but arms still feel heavy.",
    "You notice wobbling when waving or lifting bags.",
    "Gym routines helped strength, not visible arm contour.",
    "You want inch loss without surgical liposuction downtime.",

        phase: "before",
        title: "Check arm fat and skin",
        description:
          "We check fat distribution, skin laxity, muscle tone and any underarm folds, then review medical history and clothing goals to see whether non-surgical reduction is likely to show satisfying, realistic improvement.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Treat with selected device passes",
        description:
          "We mark upper arm zones, apply gel and run the device in controlled passes. You feel warmth, tugging or pressure; we adjust energy levels so sessions remain effective but tolerable.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Encourage toning and maintenance",
        description:
          "We explain basic strength moves, stretching and posture that complement device work, then space sessions and reviews to help you maintain contour changes even as daily routines become busy again.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Slimmer-looking sleeves usually appear after a few sessions, with best definition visible once devices and toning have worked together for several months.",
    recovery:
      "Temporary soreness, tightness or small bruises can happen; most people resume routine work immediately with minor adjustments.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will arm fat reduction tighten loose skin?",
      answer:
        "Devices may offer mild tightening, especially in mild laxity. Where significant loose skin exists, we discuss realistic expectations, supportive toning, sleeves choices and, if appropriate, surgical opinions rather than promising dramatic tightening.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do arms with another area together?",
      answer:
        "Often yes. Arms are commonly combined with tummy or thighs in the same visit, provided total device time, health status and your comfort allow safe, sensible planning.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will results stay if I gain weight later?",
      answer:
        "Some benefit may persist, but new weight can enlarge remaining fat cells. We emphasise long-term lifestyle habits so improvements after treatment do not fade quickly with future weight fluctuations.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is arm contouring uncomfortable during daily activities?",
      answer:
        "Mild soreness or heaviness can be felt while lifting bags or raising arms briefly. These usually settle within a couple of days with simple measures like rest and moisturiser.",
    },
  ],
