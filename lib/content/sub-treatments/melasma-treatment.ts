    tagline: "Manage hormonal brown patches",
    intro:
      "Melasma causes map-like brown patches on cheeks, forehead or upper lip, often after pregnancy, PCOS or sun. Melasma Treatment focuses on long-term control with customised creams, peels and lasers plus strict but realistic sun care.",

  quickStats: {
    sessions: "Typically long-term management",
    duration: "Reviews every 4–8 weeks",
    downtime: "Mild redness, light flaking",

  overview:
    "We classify melasma type, start pigment-suppressing creams and strong sunscreen, then add gentle peels, laser toning or specialised depigmenting masks when appropriate. The emphasis is on steady improvement and maintenance, not quick fixes that bounce back darker.",
  isThisForYou: [
    "You notice symmetrical brown patches on both cheeks, forehead or above your upper lip.",
    "Patches worsened during pregnancy, after starting pills or with unmanaged PCOS.",
    "Summer, heat and even short sun exposure make the pigmentation flare quickly.",
    "You feel frustrated because every cream seems to help for a while only.",
    "Family members also have similar patches, making you worry it is permanent.",

        title: "Confirm melasma and triggers",
        description:
          "We confirm melasma clinically, discuss pregnancies, PCOS, thyroid, pills and family history, and review past treatments. Baseline photos and sometimes Wood's lamp examination help us understand how much pigment lies deeper versus near the surface.",
      },
      {
        phase: "during",
        title: "Build a suppression protocol",
        description:
          "We prescribe pigment-suppressing creams, emphasise daily sunscreen and, when ready, introduce peels, laser toning or Cosmelan-type masks. Intensity is increased slowly, watching closely for any irritation that could itself worsen pigmentation.",
      },
      {
        phase: "after",
        title: "Shift into maintenance mode",
        description:
          "Once patches lighten, we move to simpler maintenance creams and realistic sun rules you can actually follow. We plan for summers, travel and pregnancies so flare-ups are managed early instead of becoming discouraging.",
      },
    ],
  },
  results: {
    timeline:
      "Most people see softening of borders and mild lightening by two to three months, with better control over six months or longer when medicines, procedures and sun care are followed consistently.",
    recovery:
      "Peels and masks may cause redness, tightness or flaking for a few days. With moisturiser and sun protection, most daily activities can usually continue without major disruption.",
  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is melasma completely curable with treatment?",
      answer:
        "Melasma behaves more like a chronic condition than a simple stain. Many people achieve good lightening, but patches can return with sun, hormones or pregnancy, so long-term maintenance and realistic expectations are important.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use home peels or acids for melasma?",
      answer:
        "Unsupervised acids, DIY peels and harsh scrubs often irritate and worsen melasma, especially on deeper skin tones. Supervised, measured procedures plus sunscreen are safer than experimenting with strong products at home.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need tests before starting melasma treatment?",
      answer:
        "Sometimes we suggest blood tests or gynaecology review for PCOS, thyroid or hormonal issues. Understanding underlying factors helps us match creams, tablets and procedures better to your body's reality.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stop sunscreen once melasma improves?",
      answer:
        "Unfortunately no. Sunscreen is like daily medicine for melasma. Skipping it, especially during travel or midday errands, is one of the quickest ways to bring patches back after good progress.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are lasers safe for melasma on my skin?",
      answer:
        "When used correctly, gentle laser toning can help, but wrong parameters or overuse may worsen pigmentation. We use conservative settings, longer gaps and combine lasers with creams rather than relying on machines alone.",
    },
