    intro:
      "Blackheads that return a week after every facial? Hydrafacial uses a vortex-tip handpiece to cleanse, exfoliate, vacuum out debris and infuse serums in one go—giving you clearer pores and a hydrated glow without harsh scrubbing or downtime.",

  overview:
    "Hydrafacial combines a glycolic-salicylic solution with vortex suction to loosen dead cells, extract blackheads and then push antioxidant, hydrating serums into freshly cleansed skin. It is especially helpful for congested, oily or combination skin that also needs moisture and glow.",

    "You get blackheads and whiteheads even though you cleanse well",
    "Every parlour facial leaves you red or broken out a few days later",
    "Your T-zone is oily but cheeks feel dehydrated or tight",
    "Makeup sits unevenly over bumps and clogged pores",

        description:
          "We check your current acne or pigmentation medicines, note any sensitivity and examine pore congestion. You will be asked to pause scrubs and home peels for a few days beforehand. Based on this, we choose the Hydrafacial strength and serum cocktail that makes sense for your skin.",

        phase: "during",
        title: "Vortex cleanse, peel, extract, infuse",
        description:
          "A series of passes with the Hydrafacial handpiece cleanse the skin, gently bathe it in a glycolic-salicylic solution, vacuum out blackheads and then infuse hydrating and antioxidant serums. You will feel cool liquid and rhythmic suction—most people find it oddly satisfying.",

        phase: "after",
        title: "Fresh, hydrated finish",
        description:
          "Skin looks cleaner, smoother and slightly pink, settling within an hour or two. We finish with moisturiser and sunscreen, and advise you to avoid hot water, scrubs, waxing and strong actives like retinoids or vitamin C for 24-48 hours.",

    timeline:
      "Most people see smoother texture and clearer pores immediately, with a glassy, hydrated look over the next day. Doing a series of 3-6 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart can help maintain fewer blackheads and more consistent glow.",
    recovery:
      "No true downtime. Mild redness or tightness can occur for a few hours, and very rarely, purging-type breakouts in acne-prone skin; we discuss this before starting.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Will Hydrafacial make my pores smaller permanently?",
      answer:
        "Hydrafacial can clear out blockages and make pores look tighter and less obvious, but it does not change pore size permanently. Regular maintenance and the right home care help keep them looking refined.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Hydrafacial safe if I have active acne?",
      answer:
        "It can be used in many acne cases with careful parameter choice, but if your acne is very inflamed or cystic, we may first calm it with medicines and gentler facials. Your dermatologist will decide what is safe for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get Hydrafacial just before a big event?",
      answer:
        "Yes, many people do Hydrafacial 3-7 days before a photoshoot or function. If your skin is very sensitive or acne-prone, we may recommend a test session earlier in your plan to see how you respond.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to the \"gunk\" that is removed?",
      answer:
        "The device collects the extracted debris in a waste container. Some patients like seeing it out of curiosity—it is a good visual of how much buildup has been cleared from the skin.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will one session fix my blackheads completely?",
      answer:
        "You will see a noticeable improvement after one session, but blackheads can return over time if oil production and lifestyle factors stay the same. A series of sessions plus daily skincare keeps results more stable.",
    },
