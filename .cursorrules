# Cursor Rules for PSC Project

## Git Operations
- Do NOT run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` commands without explicit permission from the user.
- The user prefers to handle version control manually.
- Only execute git commands when the user explicitly asks for it.

## Performance
- Avoid expensive CSS filters like backdrop-blur and SVG feTurbulence on elements that animate or scroll.
- Lenis smooth scroll is disabled on mobile (touch devices) for better performance.
- Prefer CSS gradients over blur filters for visual effects.
